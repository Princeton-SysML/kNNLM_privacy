?The refrigerator is so super-insulated that most of the freezer space is taken up by insulation.
But the students insist that don't need to keep much in the refrigerator because they use a "cold box," a cabinet with vents letting in cool air from the north side of the house.
"In the wintertime, it definitely suffices," Patrick says. ?
?The roof is a busy series of solar panels used to generate electricity, heat water and power the composting toilet.
A wind turbine generates some electricity, though residents say it needs to be several feet higher to really catch the breezes.
For those few times that their power needs exceed what the sun and wind can generate, there is a generator that runs on "biodiesel" fuel.
That, Patrick explains, is basically filtered vegetable oil from nearby restaurants. ?
But it isn't always only veggie oil; sometimes we stuffed in hard-core animal fat as thick as cold pudding.
I admit, there are moments we are truly going on the faith of experimentation." ?

?Whenever the Los Angeles Lakers play in Sacramento, state Assemblyman Rod Wright calls around to lobbyists to try to get tickets.
Often, Southern California Edison obliges. ?
?And the utility's generosity goes beyond basketball tickets.
Since Wright's election in 1996, Edison has donated vans to his impoverished South Central Los Angeles district, given him tens of thousands in campaign contributions and underwritten trips to Europe and South Africa. ?
?Other than a campaign fund operated by the speaker of the state Assembly, Wright received more money from Edison in 2000 than any other member of the chamber, state campaign finance records show. ?
?With California locked in a power crisis that has resulted in rolling blackouts, Edison has courted many lawmakers as it tries to avoid bankruptcy.
But none has written legislation as favorable to the company as Wright, Democratic chairman of the Energy Costs and Availability Committee.
"His single largest contributor is the one corporation that his most recent legislation would directly bail out." ?
?There is no suggestion that these contributions are illegal; all of them were duly reported by Wright and Edison.
But Jim Knox, director of the government watchdog group California Common Cause, said such close ties cause people to worry the energy crisis is being resolved on the basis of campaign contributions. ?
?Wright makes no apologies, saying he will take money from anyone who can give it legally.
But he refused to say whether he still takes energy contributions, which many elected officials have declined as too hot to handle since the energy crisis started. ?
?Brian Bennett, Edison vice president of external affairs, said it is standard for a committee chairman such as Wright to get larger contributions from a utility. ?
?Wright has received overseas trips at the expense of the power industry-supported California Foundation on Environment and the Economy.
The foundation spent a total of $20,000 taking Wright to Europe in 1999 and South Africa last year. ?
His campaign reported the expenditures as "campaign paraphernalia." ?
?Although Edison officials say they no longer give campaign contributions, records show the utility spent more than $318,000 on lobbyists in the first three months of the year. ?
This year, Keeley said he stopped taking energy money.
?Wright's contribution to the debate over Edison's future came this month with a bill he called a "straight bailout."
Lawmakers and analysts considered it the most generous to Edison of four deals the Legislature is considering. ?
Edison customers would repay the bonds over 10 to 15 years. ?
However, in the version of the bill now circulating in the Legislature, the sale of the transmission lines has been dropped. ?
?If members of the Senate and Assembly have to meet in a conference committee to settle the Edison matter, Wright will probably be involved. ?

Karen--regarding press at the WGA event.
There is an opening media conference on Sunday afternoon the 12th and a closing conference on Tuesday afternoon the 14th.
There are only about 20 press types registered to date.
That may change, however, if they get the high profile folks that they are hoping for.
Apparently they are still waiting confirmation on Galye Norton, who they are hoping will be the keynote on Sunday afternoon.
Aparently Colorada Governor Owens just cancelled this morning, and my understanding is that it has something to do with President Bush being in Denver on the 14th.
California/Washington/Texas/Alaska/Kansas will be represented by someone in each govs office, but not the govs themselves.
it's now at 12:30 our time.
Please mark your calendars accordingly.
Prior to today's Order, the ISO had been working internally and with vendors on implementation details.
Also, a conference call was held with Market Participants on October 30th to assess their implementation needs.
Based on this initial work, it appeared that implementation could occur in early January 2001 but this work is being stopped as a result of today's Order.
Attached is a copy of Enron's First Amended Complaint.?

Story on the effect of FERC prices on supply in PNW.
That could put us in a position of having rotating outages in the region."
About two weeks after the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission imposed limits on western power prices on June 19, Portland General halted installation of a new 45-megawatt gas-fired peaking turbine at its existing Boardman power plant.
The utility was developing the extra generation both to meet its customers' needs and to sell some output to other Northwest utilities left short of hydroelectric supplies due to this year's drought.
A turbine that size could power about 45,000 homes.
"You can directly attribute that to FERC price controls," Simms said.
After the FERC order, at least two utilities in Washington State ended negotiations with NRG Energy (NRG) for supplies from new plants that NRG was ready to build in time for winter.
Both utilities - Tacoma Power and Snohomish County Public Utility District - experienced significant supply shortages in the past 12 months, paid very high prices in the spot market and had to raise customer electric rates by as much as 50%.
NRG, as a result, scuttled plans to build peaking plants in Washington that could have added 300 megawatts.
In addition, the current price cap may soon be recalculated to a much lower level.
The cap is based largely on natural gas prices, which have been cut in half since the cap was first formulated in June.
Many in the western electricity industry think that's because FERC's price controls have kept prices artificially low.
A smaller group thinks the market is appropriately signaling that not all the planned gas-fired plants are needed, because some power plants are already under construction and consumers are conserving electricity.
"I see it as due to demand-side control and new units," Kemp said.
"The market is sending out a signal that we have enough.
Maybe this winter we will find that we don't have enough, but that's not the signal the market is sending now."
The spot market for power has been far below the federal price cap for two months.
Mild weather, a slowing economy and conservation efforts throughout the West have made power from expensive peaking plants unnecessary except for a few hours so far this summer.
"Prices started to come down before the FERC mitigation plan started," said Tacoma Power supply analyst David Lucio, who was negotiating with NRG.
"The need to try to execute a contract wasn't as great with the prices falling."
Lucio said there should be enough capacity to get the Northwest through the winter, barring abnormalities like a long, extended freeze.
Construction of dozens of peaking plants in the West is going forward in cases where developers sold supply contracts in advance.
Still, several western utilities have asked the FERC to raise the price cap.
Puget Sound Energy (PSD) told the FERC the cap "undercuts the Commission's efforts to ensure adequate supplies of electricity."
And orders for new generators have been canceled.

Indeed, the averages have taken a breather ahead of important economic data due tomorrow.
Additionally, more key data is due throughout the week.
On the industry front, semiconductor manufacturers, drug makers and computer software firms were outperforming.
However, the electrical equipment, telecom and manufacturing sectors were under pressure.
By midday, all the major indices continued to hover around unchanged levels as trading volume remained thinner than usual.
---------------------------------------------------------------- U.S. TREASURY SUMMARY Treasuries fluctuated to either side of unchanged in a compact range trade this morning.
Mild softness in stocks was keeping a bid in the yield curve, but volume has been light as few traders are looking to take large positions ahead of key economic data due later in the week.
Indeed, personal income and consumer confidence data are on tap for tomorrow, while a key report on manufacturing health is due on Wednesday.
Yet, traders will mainly be looking ahead to Friday's critical employment report.
Most of the excitement came overnight, as the greenback shot higher versus the yen, charging to 125 yen per dollar from around 123.5 yen.
At midday, the dollar was trading just above the 125 yen level and around 0.875 dollars per euro.
An acquisition of AT&T Broadband would give AOL control of roughly 40% of the U.S. market and about 29 million subscribers.
Microsoft has about $50 billion in cash and cash equivalent investments that it could use to thwart AOL, including encouraging other bidders to out negotiate AOL Time Warner.
This represents about a 50% premium for Heller based on the Friday closing price of its stock.
GE looks to realize a gain in its core businesses from Heller's equipment leasing and real estate finance operations.
Analysts expected Williams to earn about $0.54 per share on average.
Second-quarter revenues rose to $2.8 billion from $2.3 billion.
The company expects to meet its profit-per-share estimates, excluding items.
The Street expects Adobe to earn $0.28 per share for its upcoming quarter.

It's getting in the way of the positive message, and the math turns out to be a bit "Goreish."
(read: fuzzy) I found myself wandering down all sorts of blind alleys in my spin to Dow Jones.
I say we generalize it more.
Something to the effect of "The price caps send the wrong message to the marketplace.
Whether it's gas lines in the seventies or bread lines in the old Soviet Union, price caps and market intervention cause problems."
plz call when you get a chance.
i need to make plane res to new york.
Do you know who will be in the audience?
And how many folks we are expecting?
Also, if there are specific things that you folks want/don't want me to say, please let me know.
Our presentation will be done by Jeff Dasovich.
Grover Norquist and Americans for Tax Reform will be carrying out all logistics.
There should be time for the presentation, questions, and discussion.
I'm not too sure what FERC order he was reading.
They talk about refunds for California.
But in this case, talk really is cheap: the details of its latest order show it has no intention of making California whole.
And now FERC says Californians are not entitled to refunds even though they determined the prices were excessively high.
We are calling on FERC to change its order.
If it doesn't, we will be in court."
Also please book me an additional ticket on the same flight using MY mileage plus miles (number is 369 321 854).
Please book me at the Waldorf (midtown, like 50-ish and Lexington?
), because we have an Enron ($280) rate there.
Please book it for 3 nights--thurs/fri/sat.
You will do a great job with this.
I think it would be neat to begin with the old Blue Book vision that you were so involved with and then fast forward to the present and let Davis have it!
The crowd needs to understand the political "why's" behind his strategy and where we are now.
Also, a look at what the industry did right and wrong would be interesting to this group.
How can the think tank crowd help us going forward on the general issue of "trusting" and de-politicizing the market?

The only thing in particular I think you need to be ready for are the "federalism" questions.
If past history is an indication, there will probably be a split in the group between those who support giving FERC greater authority and control and those who oppose it on the grounds that it takes power away from states and smaller, more localized entities.

Harry, Please forward to anyone else who needs to see this.
A representative of DWR was present as were several representatives of the consulting firm Navigant which assisted DWR in constructing its revenue requirement request.
The representatives of Navigant fielded most of the questions.
Not much new information was garnered.
A little more clarity was shed on certain areas.
Other points of clarification included: (1) A question exists with respect to whether DWR is responsible for the ISO costs billed to the UDCs for the period of January through June of 2001.
(2) Any payments which were made to DWR to date by the UDCs would be netted against the revenue requirements requests for the first and second quarter of this year.
PG&E indicated that DWR's numbers for the revenue received from PG&E to date do not match its own accounting.
Once again, PG&E indicated its belief that DWR's net short projection for PG&E was erroneous.
On top of that, they need the 1.65 cents.
SCE submitted four pages of written questions to DWR on their revenue request.
DWR is to respond in writing (and serve on all people on the service list ) by Tuesday the 31st.
To the extent that the questions are applicable to PG&E, they will answer the question with respect to both UDCs.
Please call if you have any questions.
Most significantly, Richardson said the Administration will likely send a proposed rule-making to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to establish mandatory reliability standards for electricity * doing administratively what Congress failed to accomplish this year.
"California's electricity market has become dysfunctional -- and it's time to make it right," said Secretary Richardson.
"More than once, California was close to having blackouts rolling throughout the state.
In San Diego, residents and businesses saw their electric bills double almost overnight.
Consumers need an electricity system that is reliable and they should not be facing this kind of price volatility."
Richardson made the announcement in Sacramento this morning with California Gov.
Richardson said the Energy Department will take several initiatives to help the reliability of California's electricity system and protect consumers from dramatic price volatility, including: Establish mandatory reliability standards for electricity * The Energy Department will seek public comment on a proposed rulemaking that would require utilities to follow mandatory rules to protect the reliability of the electric grid in California and elsewhere.
The Administration and others have been pressing Congress to enact these much-needed rules to protect consumers.
This will help California bring in much-needed power from the Pacific Northwest; Provide millions to improve energy efficiency * The department is releasing a half million dollars in grants to the California Energy Commission to support programs that will make California buildings, which account for approximately 8 percent of all the energy used in buildings in the U.S., more energy efficient.
Separately today FERC released a report that examines the causes of California's electricity problems.
FERC also issued a proposed order that will help reduce wholesale electricity prices in California.
Richardson urged the Commission to move quickly to help protect California's citizens and businesses.

2) need the seat assignments for Prentice's booking?
I'm not sure what you've done here on your own.
Despite the summer break, leaders in the Assembly planned to call back their side of the Legislature to debate and vote on a "rescue" plan for Southern California Edison.
The new effort was outlined in our Tuesday fax to each of you.
The $2.9 billion could be used to pay QFs.
The dedicated rate component for repayment of the bonds would apply to all consumers for two years, and then apply solely to non-core customers.
The Assembly leadership planned on holding an informational meeting on the new plan on Thursday, July 26 and committee and floor votes on the plan today, Friday, July 27.
However, the leadership could not garner enough votes for this new plan this week, so no informational hearing was held, nor will any votes be held today.
Even if this new plan had been approved by the Assembly this week, Senator Burton's office made it very clear that Senator Burton had no intention of bringing his house back in to session to vote on the measure.
Accordingly, barring the governor calling the legislature back into session, we do not expect any other activity on this new plan before the legislature reconvenes on August 20, and perhaps not then either.
You can find the article at www.latimes.com.
It ran on the editorial page on Thursday, July 26.
* It is our understanding that on Thursday Senator Byron Sher had draft amendments prepared by his staff to amend SB 532 to address Renewable Portfolio Standards issues.
The amendments are not yet public, but we are hopeful that we will be able to obtain them when his staff returns next week.
We will keep you apprised.
* FERC ordered hearings on Wednesday to determine how much money electric generators owe California for wholesale power overcharges.
With California still insisting that it is owed $8.9 billion by generators, the expected FERC decision on the refund amount is certain to fall short of the state's expectations.
Lawsuits are expected to follow issuance of the decision.
If the FERC does not make California whole, we will see you in court."
* U.S. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham unveiled a plan on Monday that would expand California's power grid along Path 15 by attracting private investment to cover the $300 million project.
Meanwhile, the committee continued to move forward with their contempt proceedings against Enron and Reliant for refusing to hand over key documents to the committee.
The state claims those contracts equal about $160 million while Reliant calculates that the same contracts are worth more than $300 million.
A judge is expected to oversee this dispute.

Sue, Jeff: Did either you hear who the 5 people were at CDWR who got reassigned as a result of their trading utility stocks while negotiating with generators?

5 State Energy Advisors Fired Over Conflicts Ethics: The consultants were involved in buying electricity for California from a generator whose stock they owned, setting up a clash of official duties, personal interests.
A sixth consultant hired to help California purchase electricity has quit, according to state records.
All were involved in purchasing electricity for the state from a generator whose stock they owned.
In addition, the top lawyer for the agency buying the power was removed from her position because of concern about the way the issue of potential conflicts was handled.
Top advisors to Gov.
Gray Davis told The Times that they learned of the conflicts in the last week, after belatedly asking the consultants to file required economic disclosure statements.
State law prohibits officials from participating in decisions involving their personal financial interests.
Although portraying himself as seriously concerned that such conflicts could undermine public confidence, the governor has not required some of his most influential private-sector advisors to file the kind of disclosure statements that led to the firings.
Among them are two Wall Street veterans who have been most influential in promoting the governor's energy rescue plan, which includes the largest state bond sale in U.S. history.
The companies stand to make an additional $14 million if the state goes through with the purchase of utility transmission lines.
Davis contends that Fichera, Hoffman and their associates fall into a separate category of advisor, beyond the reach of the state's political reform laws.
Critics question the distinction.
Disclosure is crucial because the public needs to know that "decisions are not being made by people who have a conflict of interest," Knox said.
"Trying to evade the law with a creative use of semantics is not what they ought to be doing."
The firings disclosed Friday are unlikely to diminish criticism surrounding the more than 50 consultants and advisors hastily hired by the administration as it rushed into the power trading business this year.
More than $25 million is being spent by the state on consultants, according to state records.
In the process, seemingly little attention was paid to routine government ethics laws.
It took six months for state officials to direct the consultants to file even basic disclosures of their personal finances, including investments.
The state Political Reform Act normally requires such forms to be filed publicly within 30 days of starting work for state agencies.
Even with the hastily ordered disclosures made public thus far, the circumstances of most of the stock transactions remain a mystery because key information was omitted.
Most of the consultants, for example, failed to state when they bought the energy stocks.
One of those pressing hardest for an investigation of possible conflict of interest violations and insider trading is Secretary of State Bill Jones, a Republican who hopes to challenge Davis next year.
Jones has accused the governor of "a conscious policy of secrecy" in enforcing compliance with public disclosure laws.
This week Jones called for a federal Securities and Exchange Commission probe of stock purchases by state energy consultants.
Their investments ranged from several thousand dollars to more than $100,000, records show.
While working for the state Department of Water Resources, officials said they bought undetermined amounts of Calpine power on the state's behalf.
More than $14 million worth of electricity was purchased from the state by Calpine in the first quarter of this year, according to the most recent records available.
A former assistant general manager with the Sacramento Municipal Utility District, Ferreira was paid $200 an hour by the state.
Ferreira could not be reached for comment.
All of them formerly worked as energy schedulers at the Power Exchange, a now-defunct energy market similar to a stock exchange created in the early days of California's electricity deregulation.
Mead, 55, a former Edison engineer, said state officials never warned him that owning energy stock was a problem until they demanded that he sell the stock a week ago.
He said he bought nearly all of his shares 2 1/2 years ago for $12,000 and saw its value skyrocket as the stock split three times, doubling in value each time.
Mead said he was called by the head of the state's energy buying team Thursday and fired.
"I asked very directly, 'Is this because of the stock?'
and they wouldn't give me an answer," Mead said.
"[He] just said your services are terminated.
I guess it's just politics and we're the pawns."
Administration officials said they also are examining the actions of other traders, including one who bought Calpine stock just before beginning work for the state.
Griffin, who the governor's office said had obtained another job, could not be reached for comment.
One of those, a 20-year deal signed Feb. 27, was the longest.
The state has awarded Calpine about $13 billion in contracts to supply power for up to 20 years.
Another consultant bought stock in Reliant Energy of Houston, a large power plant operator that bought several California plants from utilities after deregulation.
Purchase of Enron Stock Defended "I don't see a conflict," he said.
"At the time, we weren't really dealing with Enron.
I [still] haven't bought from Enron."
Barretto said he never considered his Enron ownership a possible conflict until he received notice July 18 that he had to sell the stocks by noon or lose his job.
That notice came from Goode, the governor's lawyer.
"We expect and have always expected the state's consultants to uphold the highest ethical standards," he wrote.
"That standard is not met by those who hold a financial interest in one or more energy companies while trading on behalf of the state on energy related matters."
"Therefore each consultant who holds an interest in an energy company must divest himself or herself of that interest by noon today.
If he or she refuses, the state will sever its contract with that person."
Davis aides cite an opinion sought last week from attorney Raquelle de la Rocha, a former member of the Los Angeles Ethics Commission and the state Fair Political Practices Commission.
She concluded that the advisors do not have to file disclosure statements because they are contractors, not consultants, and will be working for less than a year on a limited range of projects.
He has pitched the plan to lawmakers, reporters and the Wall Street financial community.
Fichera refused to comment on the record.
The decision not to require public disclosure of their financial holdings stands in sharp contrast to the approach taken with Montague DeRose and Associates.
That consulting firm was hired on a $1.8-million contract.
Like the other two firms, it too was hired to provide "financial advisory services" to the state.
That firm's top advisor, Douglas S. Montague, was required by the administration to fill out a disclosure statement.
He reported no power company interests.
The governor's legal advisors said the difference is that Montague is on a longer contract.

The details of the landmark probe prepared by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is scheduled to be released Wednesday morning, but some commissioners told Dow Jones Newswires the report will suggest that the state's mandatory buy rule should be abolished and utilities should be permitted to purchase their power through other power exchanges.
It is widely known in the wholesale electricity market that Sempra Energy (SRE) unit San Diego Gas & Electric Co. purchased most of their power in the spot market, which the utility passed on to its customers at a much higher price.
SDG&E also complained to federal regulators that the CalPX hourly and day-ahead market clearing prices are too high.
But the FERC report proposes that utilities be permitted to purchase power from other exchanges in an effort to generate increased competition, commissioners said.
The CalPX purchases power one day in advance for California's three investor-owned utilities.
Suppliers bid in power indicating their price.
For each hour of the next day, the price of the last megawatt taken to meet demand sets the market price.
In various reports issued since 1996, FERC has commended the state's Power Exchange for running a successful market that helped mitigate concerns about market power abuses.
If the FERC report suggests that California end the mandatory buy requirement, it will be up to state lawmakers to see to draft Legislation to change the market rules, according to the CalPX.
I'm pretty sure that is the same Ms McFadden.
Might be interesting for you to contact her.
Let's discuss a bit more.
I'll call you tomorrow, if you're around.
Thanks again for the info.

Most significantly, Richardson said the Administration will likely send a proposed rule-making to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to establish mandatory reliability standards for electricity * doing administratively what Congress failed to accomplish this year.
"California's electricity market has become dysfunctional -- and it's time to make it right," said Secretary Richardson.
"More than once, California was close to having blackouts rolling throughout the state.
In San Diego, residents and businesses saw their electric bills double almost overnight.
Consumers need an electricity system that is reliable and they should not be facing this kind of price volatility."
Richardson made the announcement in Sacramento this morning with California Gov.
Richardson said the Energy Department will take several initiatives to help the reliability of California's electricity system and protect consumers from dramatic price volatility, including: Establish mandatory reliability standards for electricity * The Energy Department will seek public comment on a proposed rulemaking that would require utilities to follow mandatory rules to protect the reliability of the electric grid in California and elsewhere.
The Administration and others have been pressing Congress to enact these much-needed rules to protect consumers.
This will help California bring in much-needed power from the Pacific Northwest; Provide millions to improve energy efficiency * The department is releasing a half million dollars in grants to the California Energy Commission to support programs that will make California buildings, which account for approximately 8 percent of all the energy used in buildings in the U.S., more energy efficient.
Separately today FERC released a report that examines the causes of California's electricity problems.
FERC also issued a proposed order that will help reduce wholesale electricity prices in California.
Richardson urged the Commission to move quickly to help protect California's citizens and businesses.

The President could have her own investigation or propose her own solutions -- all the while delaying the suspension.
Brian also thought she could possibly put her own DA plan in place -- although he said it was a "stretch."
Brian said she could, for example, argue that limiting DA to the net short position was a way of implementing ABX 1.
He felt that adding an exit fee as well was , however, stretching the concept a bit too far.
Nonethless, limiting DA to a net short position could be argued to be within her existing authority under the law.
Let's discuss strategy on our next call.

Follow-up on Monday California conference call, regarding passthrough of the 1 cent surcharge.
SCE: Does NOT appear to be passing through the 1 cent surcharge to Direct Access.
.. SCE, however, is not entirely sure whether the Commission intends to exempt the DA customers from the 1 cent per kWh surcharge and has previously requested Energy Division's opinion on this matter."
This letter was responding to a request by AReM for clarification of this very issue.
So, SCE seems to think the PUC has been unclear about whether the 1 cent surcharge applies to Direct Access, and as a result is not billing it to Direct Access.
This is in spite of the PUC's January 4 order, where it said "All other customers, including direct access customers, are subject to this surcharge."
(p. 21) Of course, it is not at all clear what SCE will do if the PUC clarifies for SCE that they could have been billing the surcharge to Direct Access customers.
PG&E: Is passing through the 1 cent surcharge to Direct Access.
Where are the $$ from the surcharges going?
The revenues the utilities have collected and continue to collect from the one-cent per kilowatt-hour rate increase authorized on January 4, 2001 shall be used to pay for power purchases and not for any other costs incurred by the utilities. "

Staying at the W. When and where would you like to hook up?
The purpose of this e-mail is to discuss the regulatory strategy in California.
We will have to do this strategically to avoid negative consequences.
Work with PG&E and SCE on developing a post-freeze solution at the legislature to recover undercollections over a 5 year period in order to facilitate an acceptable solution.
Watch and prevent adverse changes to how the PX credit is calculated.
Since I get everything that you forward, you may remove me from you distribution list.
Hope all is well.
Hope you've managed to stay a night or two in your house recently.
Do you think that it would be OK to call your cousin in Sea Ranch?
If you think he wouldn't mind having me call, might you have his phone number (and full name)?
As always, greatly appreciated.

This is THE story out here today.
Gee, couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
His disclosure came several days after Gov.
Gray Davis dismissed five state power purchasers for owning stock in the company and drew new complaints that Davis administration officials may have improperly mixed their private finances and their public roles.
He said that threshold was met June 20, the day after an action by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission brought down "all energy stock prices across the board."
Maviglio said he bought the stock for his individual retirement account, and it has since declined in value.
Under terms of the open order, he said, he had no control over the exact date of purchase.
Maviglio touted the company in his role as spokesman to the governor in a story published June 27 in The Bee.
He said Monday that he was simply responding to a reporter's question about the company's positive reputation.
"Their pricing has been far more reasonable than any other generator."
Maviglio acknowledged the stock ownership several days after the administration ended its relationship with several energy consultants who held stock in energy companies, including Calpine.
Under pressure from Secretary of State Bill Jones, a Republican who hopes to challenge Davis for governor next year, the Davis administration has spent several weeks scrambling to answer questions about the stock holdings and potential conflicts of its consultants and energy traders.
Jones said Monday that Maviglio should be fired.
He said the Democratic governor should direct all of his staff to immediately file updated conflict-of-interest statements to reflect current holdings.
Jones, who last week asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate administration consultants for insider trading, also said the probe should be expanded "to include all of the governor's staff."
Federal law and SEC regulations forbid anyone from trading stocks while possessing "insider information" -- relevant facts not available to the public, according to the SEC.
Violations can bring lawsuits and criminal prosecution.
Michael Prozan, a Menlo Park lawyer and expert on insider trading, said the prohibition against it originally focused on halting company executives from profiting from news before it was disclosed publicly.
But the laws have been broadened to include others besides company employees.
Investment bankers, lawyers and journalists have been snared by insider-trading crackdowns.
Davis' office was instrumental earlier this year in paving the way for removing barriers to construction of a Calpine plant in San Jose.
On May 30, after opposing the project for years, San Jose Mayor Ron Gonzales announced he had negotiated an agreement addressing his concerns and agreed to support construction.
His action came after Davis in April endorsed the plant's construction and as the state Energy Commission threatened to approve it over local objections.
On June 20, the company announced it had won tentative state approval to build the plant.
Maviglio said he buys many stocks and that Enron Corp. and Calpine are the only energy generators among them.
He owns 100 shares of Enron stock, which he purchased in 1996.
"I deal with hundreds of California companies just about every day, and this was one that I saw that looked like a good investment based on public knowledge," he said.
"I read six newspapers a day or more, and I know what's going on in the world.
If there's a standard that I can't invest in something that I have general public knowledge of, then I wouldn't have any stocks at all."
Maviglio said that the "open" order he placed meant that he could not have used inside information to make his stock purchase.
"Had I had specific knowledge about a contract being signed or what actually happened in the office of the mayor of San Jose ... that would have been unrelated," Maviglio said.
"There was no timing-based sequence to it."
The order was executed as the stock dipped below $40 on June 20, closing that day at $39.85.
The day before, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission announced a price-control plan that investors believed was damaging to generators' profits.
On Monday, the stock closed at $37.13.
Last week, the Davis administration stopped doing business with five energy traders under contract with the administration after Maviglio said administration lawyers "came to the determination that there are possible violations of the law or close to it."
"It's not a crime to own energy stock," Maviglio said Monday.
"The difference with these traders is they're making governmental decisions.
They're committing the state's resources by spending money to buy power."
Jim Knox, director of California Common Cause, said he believes the Governor's Office made critical errors while hiring staff to purchase energy for the state.

David Freeman and DWR....public power working for California.
******************************************************** Power delivery efficiency questioned: Output at low-cost generating plants has been cut while costlier ones continue to operate.
The sporadic episodes haven't cost much yet, but they illustrate a potentially troubling disconnect in the system that has quickly grown between two agencies that help deliver electricity to a power-strapped state.
The trouble is that the ISO, created in 1996 to manage the power grid in a deregulated electric market, tries to run the grid by auctions that -- in theory -- provide the cheapest electricity for the state's consumers.
"We have an inefficient market and an inept government entity.
It's sort of the worst of both worlds," Florio said, criticizing his agency and the DWR.
ISO staffers decline to discuss the situation in detail, saying it involves confidential bidding behavior.
The state's role is to buy electricity for customers of utilities whose credit was no longer good enough to buy on their own, he said.
"We're not in it to do those kinds of marketing functions," he said.
"It's not necessarily a good fit."
Some of the ISO auctions are used to lessen congestion on transmission lines.
Others are used to stabilize the grid by slightly increasing or decreasing output when demand doesn't match forecasts.
Generally, the highest-cost power plants should be the ones cutting back, a process the industry calls "decking."
Industry experts agree that such below-cost sales are common in a business where power needs fluctuate dramatically based on the weather.
By contrast, "this is a dead weight loss.
Higher costs are being incurred for no good reason," Florio said.
"The question is, why is the ISO calling on Mohave and not (cheaper) gas plants?
For its part, the ISO will say only that "we are making the most economical decisions we can based on the bids available," said spokeswoman Stephanie McCorkle.
DWR's Garris said the state and the ISO have been meeting repeatedly on bidding and other coordination issues, and he hopes to have a smoother-running system in place by next summer.

?State and Regional, 471 words, Federal order limits potential state refunds ???
Peter Navarro is, an associate professor of economics and public policy at UC Irvine BODY: ?
Gray Davis' spin doctors want us to believe that these $43-billion long-term contracts were both necessary and the impetus for a moderating energy market.
Here's the real story: ?
This "sellers cartel" first drained our electric utilities dry.
In November, it became the taxpayers' turn to be victimized, when the Davis administration gave carte blanche authority to the Department of Water Resources for energy purchases.
This required the state Public Utilities Commission to pass the largest rate hike in California history and will require the state to issue $12.4 billion in bonds this fall to service this debt. ?
This was an ill-advised long-term strategy to fight a short-run crisis.To understand why, look at the negotiating chessboard from the electricity cartel's perspective.
The cartel's negotiators knew that within 18 to 24 months, there would be a huge glut of power on the market as many power plants were already under construction in California and throughout the West.
Once the new energy resources were available, the cartel would no longer be able to manipulate the market.
This supply glut would drive prices back to the 1999 range of three to five cents per kilowatt-hour, far lower than the prices now set in the long-term energy contracts. ?
?To the cartel members, this looming power glut was a recipe for heavy losses.
Locking the state into long-term contracts at lucrative rates was their redemption.
The Davis administration walked into this market inferno, bargaining from extreme weakness at the top of the market, signing contracts that were too expensive.
The administration also capitulated on two highly objectionable clauses.
The first requires the state to absorb all costs of environmental protection for many of the generators.
The second holds the generators "harmless" for any increase in taxes imposed on the generators by the state.
This provision essentially freezes taxes on the generators over the next several years, requiring taxpayers to pick up the tab. ?
?The bottom line is this: Long after the rolling blackouts stop, California still will be saddled with billions of dollars of unnecessary electricity costs and high bond debt.
These higher costs will hurt consumers and businesses, put heavy pressure on the state budget for years and inhibit the state's economic growth. ?
?There are two lessons from this multibillion-dollar mistake.
The first is to have full public review of major energy decisions.
Equally important, the Public Utilities Commission must be allowed to retain its rate-making authority so that problems are not hidden in a state bureaucracy.

GOP rival of governor requested the inquiry.
?The Securities and Exchange Commission has launched a preliminary inquiry into whether energy consultants advising Gov.
Gray Davis used inside information to trade stocks of power companies doing business with the state, a source with knowledge of the matter said Monday. ?
?The federal agency began its review late last week, the source said, in response to a request from California Secretary of State Bill Jones.
A Republican rival of Davis, Jones charged that stock trading by consultants may have violated federal laws barring buying and selling based on information not available to the public. ?
?On Friday, top aides to the governor disclosed that five consultants had been fired for possible conflicts of interest between their official positions and their personal finances. ?
?As news of the SEC inquiry spread through the capital Monday, Davis officials were confronted by a flurry of questions about who in the administration owns energy stocks. ?
Maviglio said he bought the shares in Houston-based Enron Corp. in 1996.
"It's not a crime to own energy stock," Maviglio said. ?
It has since fallen in value.
?The Davis administration has spared Calpine the kind of fierce criticisms that it has leveled at other electricity suppliers, such as Enron.
But California's grid operator has identified the company as one of many energy merchants to overcharge the state millions of dollars. ?
?The fired consultants also owned shares in Calpine, ranging in value from several thousand dollars to more than $100,000, records show. ?
?In a statement, Goode said he sold his stock in Williams Co's.
a month after he began working for the governor in February.
Goode said the shares were supposed to be sold before he went on the state payroll, but his broker failed to do so. ?
?In light of the recent disclosures, Secretary of State Jones said the governor must do more to ensure the public that its interest comes first.
"The governor should direct all of his staff to immediately file updated conflict of interest statements that reflect current holdings and any activity since their last statement of economic interest was filed," said Jones, who is seeking the GOP nomination for governor. ?
?Word of the SEC's entry into California's energy problems comes as the governor faces harsh criticism from lawmakers and others for the quick and broad hiring of highly paid private consultants to guide him through the crisis. ?
?State law prohibits officials from participating in decisions involving their personal financial interests. ?
?The five consultants fired last week were among 11 named in Jones' letter, delivered to the San Francisco office of the SEC last Wednesday.
It was not clear which individuals are the focus of the SEC's inquiry, or whether the agency's review would result in any charges. ?
?Two of the former traders said Monday that they had not been contacted by federal investigators and knew nothing of an inquiry into possible insider trading. ?
Calpine power was not traded on that exchange, so there was no conflict of interest, he said. ?
Fired traders Herman Leung, Peggy Cheng and Constantine Louie did not list the date of their Calpine purchases on financial statements that the state required to be filed only two weeks ago.
"It was kind of like a hobby.
I'm sure it wasn't done with the intent to manipulate." ?
"I kind of feel like we've been used for political reasons," Griffin said.
"We would have disclosed anything right at first, but they never asked." ?
"Now they will not receive one red cent," said Hiltachk.
"Very simply Mr. Fabiani and Mr. Lehane have agreed to cease all activities for the governor, to accept no payments for their services and to basically get out of the consulting business with the governor." ?
?Uhler had filed a lawsuit against the two consultants and Controller Kathleen Connell in June contending that they should not receive any payments because of a conflict of interest.
The two men also did consulting work for financially troubled Southern California Edison, which was seeking help from Davis and the Legislature. ?
?Connell, a former Los Angeles mayoral candidate who has been at odds with Davis since he endorsed an opponent, had held up the payments pending the outcome of the lawsuit. ?

Gray Davis has been searching for a way to bail out the insolvent Southern California Edison, which has contributed more than $350,000 to Davis' campaign coffers.
An attempt to bring the California Assembly back from its summer recess to vote on a new bailout bill Friday was just the latest such effort to fall apart. ?
The Aug. 15 deadline for legislative approval of some semblance of the very sweet deal negotiated last spring by Davis looms, yet the California Legislature is in recess until Aug. 20.
Not surprisingly, Davis and Edison preferred a more generous bill by Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg of Los Angeles.
But that bill, its fate complicated by an even more straightforward bailout offered by another Los Angeles Democrat, didn't make it through the Assembly. ?
The transmission lines are major strategic assets affording the state more leverage over power generators, which is why their acquisition by the state is opposed by the Bush-Cheney administration. ?
?The bailout is a huge priority for Davis, who has populated the top ranks of his energy team with Edison alumni.
This is twice as much as given by now bankrupt Pacific Gas & Electric, a larger company. ?
?The ties and tilt are obvious.
Ironically, their hiring highlighted the dense web of connections between Davis and Edison. ?
?Lehane and Clinton damage control counsel Mark Fabiani played a major role in implementing the new strategy of bashing Bush and Cheney.
But the two brought an enormous amount of controversy with them to their roles, both because of their $ 30,000 monthly contract with the state and because they worked concurrently for Edison.
After some confusing reports several weeks ago suggesting that the duo had dropped their work for Edison, Lehane brushed them aside and told me that, yes, they were still working for Edison to gain a state bailout of the company and that there was no conflict of interest there.
A seemingly fair result, though some public interest advocates insist that state conflict-of-interest law prohibits his employment in any event, pointing out that his work for Edison occurred within the last year.
?Meanwhile, top Edison officials said again last week that the utility will go bankrupt without a bailout.
Wall Street had expected a modest profit. ?
Through the L.A. Times, Edison this week trumpeted its utility's recently improved cash flow, which may well stave off moves by creditors to force the utility into bankruptcy while the politicians try again to sort things out. ?
?But the governor's close ties to Edison continue to rankle many in the Capitol and elsewhere.
Davis has long been aligned with Edison chieftain John Bryson, who made his reputation as a pro-alternative energy Public Utilities Commission president in the Jerry Brown administration before becoming a bete noire to many environmentalists and renewable power advocates in his current role. ?
Rosenfield promises to mount an initiative campaign to derail any bailout deal. ?
?Many legislators feel the same way, noting that the sky did not fall after PG&E went bankrupt.
Sen. Mike Machado, a conservative Central Valley Democrat, says that bankruptcy court can do a better job of sorting out Edison's finances than the Legislature.
Some liberals privately disdain Edison for its role in crafting the state's deregulation debacle.
And Republican legislators are having a field day sounding like consumer advocates. ?
?Notwithstanding the struggle over the fate of Edison, California is in better shape than most feared a few months ago.
Not only do the contracts eschew renewables, a number of them provide the actual financial underpinnings for a new generation of fossil fuel plants, guaranteeing their profitability for the companies developing them.
A troubling result for the Democratic administration of a state that by itself is the world's fifth-largest economy, especially at a time when most of the rest of the world is criticizing the Republican administration in Washington for refusing to deal with the greenhouse effect. ?
?Meanwhile, there has been no federal order of refunds for the astonishing price run-up California has experienced over the past year.
With refunds, the state could bail out Edison and perhaps PG&E as well.
But two weeks of negotiations in Washington earlier this summer between state officials and power generators went nowhere.
Which is precisely where the Edison bailout remains.

"It's not just the threat of blackouts or the highest rate hikes in history.
It's the fact that PG&E is in bankruptcy.
It's the depletion of the state budget," she said.
"This is a hell of an opportunity."
?The opportunity she is talking about centers on two November ballot measures that would pave the way for creating a public power system and taking Pacific Gas and Electric Co. out of the city's electricity market.
?One proposal, an initiative placed on the ballot by residents, calls for setting up a municipal utility district in San Francisco and neighboring Brisbane.
The district would be governed by an elected board of directors.
?The other measure, placed on the ballot last week by the Board of Supervisors, would create a municipal water and power agency and would affect only San Francisco.
?PG&E has mounted a campaign to defeat the measures, so far pumping more than $200,000 into the effort.
"They're confusing and do nothing to address the problem."
?The company has a history of opposing public power proposals, derailing a plan in Davis in the 1990s and using a legal challenge to stall the start of Sacramento's Municipal Utility District for two decades.
?For years, private utilities have enjoyed a powerful hold on state and local politicians.
But the energy crisis has caused widespread public anger and concern, forcing city and state officials to take another look at public power.
?San Francisco already owns a power system, Hetch Hetchy, which provides power for city departments.
PG&E provides power to residents and businesses.
?The San Francisco Charter amendment placed on the ballot by the supervisors calls for abolishing the city's existing Public Utilities Commission, which is run by commissioners and a director appointed by the mayor.
The proposed public power board would have seven elected directors, but the agency still would retain some ties to City Hall.
?The supervisors' plan is intended to be used as a backup to the municipal utility district -- commonly known as a MUD -- which is considered to be more vulnerable to the expected legal challenges from PG&E.
?San Francisco is not alone in looking at public power.
San Diego, the first city to feel the hard pinch of the energy crisis, wants to establish a regional public power system in an attempt to pool resources and bring down energy costs.
?The East Bay Municipal Utility District, which provides water and sewer service, is considering expanding its reach to power.
In the Bay Area, the cities of Alameda and Palo Alto already have public power.
The two largest public power agencies in the state serve Los Angeles and Sacramento.
?In San Francisco, the pro-public power forces are going to tout the promised virtues of turning the electric utility over to a public authority that by law cannot turn a profit.
That, they contend, means lower rates.
?On average, consumers pay 18 percent less for power from public utilities, he said.
?Gallagher, spokesman for the opposition campaign, said ratepayers shouldn't assume that public power means lower energy bills.
"There's no way the rates are going down," he said.
?He blamed the energy crisis not on deregulation but on a shortage of electricity, which jacked up prices and undercut reliability.
"The measures do nothing about supply," Gallagher said.
"All this will do is cost people money.
You can't just take PG&E's assets.
You have to pay for them." ?

Gray Davis' administration came under fresh attack yesterday when his chief spokesman admitted buying $12,000 worth of Calpine Corp. stock last month.
He said he would sell the stock if Davis or administration lawyers asked him to.
"I invested in a growing California company," Maviglio said.
"It's sad when somebody tries to link owning energy stock with a conflict of interest."
?The revelation came the same day that two high-priced consultants Davis brought in earlier this year to help sell his energy policies to the public agreed not to take any money for the work they have done.
Davis was criticized for hiring the two, partly because they had also worked as consultants for Southern California Edison.
Four of the five owned stock in Calpine, and the fifth held Enron shares.
?Maviglio, who had the task of explaining the firings, was on the defensive himself yesterday.
?He bought the Calpine stock in June after asking his broker to invest in it when shares hit a certain price, he said.
He said that showed he had made his decision independently of whatever action he might have taken in the governor's office on any particular day.
?Calpine's stock has dropped some in the past month.
?Maviglio said he had spoken out against Calpine as much as other energy companies.
He also owns Enron stock that he bought in February 1996 and has disclosed on all forms, he added.
"He had the power to promote Calpine through press releases.
That seems to me to be a clear conflict of interest."
?The Davis administration tried to put another energy-related controversy behind it yesterday as the two consultants brought in by the governor to burnish his image agreed to forgo more than $50,000 in work they did for the state.
?Chris Lehane and Mark Fabiani will receive no compensation and will leave the Davis administration immediately, under a settlement in a lawsuit filed on behalf of a national taxpayer rights group.
?It was later revealed that they had also worked as consultants for Southern California Edison, which is trying to swing a deal with the state to avoid bankruptcy.
State Controller Kathleen Connell said she would not pay the two.
said Lewis Uhler, president of the National Tax Limitation Committee, which filed the lawsuit.
?In June, Davis said Fabiani was no longer a communications consultant because his work had been "successfully implemented."
Lehane, on the other hand, dropped his contract with Edison and signed a new agreement with Davis.
?Lehane's new contract required him to work a maximum of 66 hours a month at $150 an hour.
His payments were to be capped at $76,000 for work from June 26 to Nov. 20, 2001.
"This was an outrageous expense to taxpayers," Uhler said.
"I believe there was a clear violation of conflict-of-interest laws."
?The consultants decided it was not worth the legal fees to fight the lawsuit, Maviglio said.
The two could not be reached for comment.
"It's shameful when people have to surrender their jobs in public service because of a lawsuit," Maviglio said.
Their attempts to mitigate the damage from these violations is too little, too late."
?Jones said Davis should immediately require all of the consultants hired during the energy crisis to file financial statements.
There are 21 advisers involved in power purchasing whom Davis has exempted, he said.
?All the contractors who are required to file reports have done so, said Maviglio.
?In a related development, the Los Angeles Times quoted a source as saying the Securities and Exchange Commission has launched a preliminary inquiry into whether energy consultants advising Davis used inside information to trade stocks of power companies doing business with the state.

?Whether Baltimore Gas and Electric can remain profitable after spinning off its power generating and marketing efforts to create a new company is the subject of a three-day before state regulators this week. ?
?Regulators are hoping to avoid the problems that followed the deregulation of the electricity market in California, where skyrocketing power prices led to blackouts and financial problems for utilities unable to pass on higher costs to consumers because of rate regulations. ?
?The Public Service Commission will decide whether BGE, the largest utility in the state, can remain profitable if it is allowed to leave Constellation Energy Group Inc. later this year. ?
?Regulators are concerned about the utility's ability to provide electricity to consumers at rates frozen until 2006 under last year's deregulation agreement. ?
?Constellation announced plans in October to split into two publicly traded companies.
?A consultant to the people's counsel warned that such a high debt level could make it difficult for the utility to handle unexpected problems such as severe ice storms, hurricanes or spikes in the price of electricity. ?
?Constellation has submitted extensive confidential information to the PSC about the separation, but it is still unclear what could happen if the commission seeks to alter or block the plan. ?
?Although Constellation has fully cooperated with the PSC, company officials maintain that the state has no authority over the transaction. ?
?The hearing, which begins Monday, runs through Wednesday.

Gray Davis' press secretary recently purchased the same energy stock as five consultants the governor fired last week, he disclosed Monday. ?
?Maviglio's disclosure comes after Davis' office hastily ended the contracts of five consultants who helped negotiate state power contracts and held stock in energy companies. ?
?In a related development, an anonymous source told the Los Angeles Times on Monday that the Securities and Exchange Commission has launched a preliminary inquiry into whether the consultants used inside information to trade the energy stocks. ?
?About two dozen Davis energy consultants were required to fill out financial disclosure statements after complaints of conflict of interest by Republicans and consumer groups.
?Jones, a Republican, is a candidate for the GOP nomination to challenge Davis in November 2002. ?
?Maviglio defended his purchase, saying that he "owns several stocks in companies in all fields that are growing and are based in California." ?
?Maviglio said Monday that he requested on May 31 to purchase the stock if it dipped to $40 a share, which it did two days after a June 18 ruling by federal energy regulators restricting wholesale electricity prices in California and 10 other states. ?
?Maviglio served as Davis' chief spokesman urging the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to impose price ceilings on electricity wholesalers. ?
He said he purchased the stock in 1997 and has reported it on financial disclosure forms.
He said that it is "closer to $10,000." ?
?Meanwhile, two energy consultants to Davis have agreed to forgo more than $ 50,000 in work they did for the state. ?
?Fabiani could not be reached for comment Monday.
In the settlement, they admitted no wrongdoing. ?
?Lehane issued a statement through the governor's office, calling it "simply not worth the bother to challenge the controller in court." ?
?Both also have advised Southern California Edison, which is negotiating for state help in avoiding bankruptcy.
Financial disclosure forms showed they have each received at least $10,000 from Edison in the past year. ?
"We wanted to block the egregious use of taxpayer funds for essentially political spinmeisters," he said.

?California will receive refunds for overpriced electricity, but not as much as it had asked for. ?
?A closer reading of last week's order from federal energy regulators shows the amount the state will receive could be slashed to just under $4 billion less than half what the state requested.
Gray Davis plans to appeal the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission decision Monday, state officials said.
Refunds could help prevent the state from raising electric rates to cover its power buying costs, which are now beyond $8 billion.
?For months, Davis and other state officials have asked the commission to rule electricity prices charged since May 2000 to be unjust and unreasonable prices which climbed 10 times higher than past years. ?
?The state stands to lose a portion of the billions it has spent buying electricity for Pacific Gas and Electric Co. customers and two other financially ailing utilities.
Power companies maintain they did not work together to drive up power prices to unreasonable levels. ?
That means $2 billion less than the state, utilities and others could hope to receive, McFadden said. ?
?In addition, the commission also said it will not issue refunds for power the state Department of Water Resources bought directly from power companies.
FERC only will recognize purchases through the state's now-defunct power market or from the manager of the state's power grid. ?
State officials had hoped to receive up to $9 billion in refunds. ?
?A call to FERC for comment was not immediately returned Sunday. ?
?The commission has ordered an evidentiary hearing, to be completed within 60 days, to determine the size of the refund from providers of wholesale power.

?After several delays, the entrance of Texas into the deregulated electricity market is set to begin Tuesday. ?
?The Legislature created the pilot program to give power companies several months to test their systems before full-scale deregulation, which is scheduled to begin Jan. 1 in most of the state. ?
?Industry officials have promised that deregulation will be smoother in Texas than in California, where it has been blamed for rolling blackouts and skyrocketing utility rates.
They say the recent construction of several new power plants in Texas will help the state avoid supply shortfalls that have plagued California. ?
?Deregulation allows customers to choose their power provider much like they select a long-distance telephone carrier.
Under the Texas pilot program, up to 5 percent of electric customers can switch power companies. ?
?The pilot program is getting under way nearly two months after its first scheduled start date of June 1.
Numerous delays were caused by computer problems. ?

?Developments in California's energy crisis: ??MONDAY: ?
?- After several delays, the entrance of Texas into the deregulated electricity market is set to begin Tuesday.
Under a pilot program, officials of the state's electrical grid will begin switching some customers to new power providers at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday. ?
?- The third largest bankruptcy in U.S. history is also becoming the most complex.
As Pacific Gas and Electric Co. wades through its pile of debts, many of the legal and financial teams representing the utility and its creditors often run into conflicts of interest. ?
?- The state has been joined by natural gas industry players in accusing Houston-based El Paso Corp. of restricting the flow of natural gas into California to drive up its price and ultimately the cost to ratepayers.
The gas shippers that lease the pipeline space now also say El Paso is to blame for soaring California energy prices.
Those accusations came following a federal regulatory hearing in May, the San Francisco Chronicle reported Sunday. ?
?- California will receive refunds for overpriced electricity, but not as much as it had asked for.
A closer reading of last week's order from federal energy regulators shows the amount the state will receive could be slashed to just under $4 billion - less than half of what the state requested.
Gray Davis plans to appeal the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission decision, state officials say.
Refunds could help prevent the state from raising electric rates to cover its power buying costs, which are now beyond $8 billion. ?
?- The deadline for the Legislature to approve Davis' rescue deal for Southern California Edison is Aug. 15. ?
PG&E, saying it hasn't received the help it needs from regulators or state lawmakers, filed for federal bankruptcy protection April 6.

Gray Davis with regard to California's electricity crisis.
The governor has scored some nice publicity by switching on some new power plants.
The weather has been unseasonably cool.
His poll numbers are edging back up.
Yet beneath this optimistic picture lie troubling problems.
For example, Davis's argument that out-of-state power generators are responsible for the electricity crisis has been falling apart.
For months, Davis has been claiming that private generators have overcharged California by $8.9 billion and demanded that this amount be refunded to the state.
The chief judge thinks not."
Davis's position, as usual, is motivated purely by politics.
Davis responded to this revelation in typical political fashion.
Yet, for all Davis' feigned indignation about consumers being ripped off, it turns out that he and his regulators are poised to ensure that business consumers are ripped off by state government.
This is especially important to Davis since the high prices are borne disproportionately by business.
No matter how much Davis points the finger, Californians are paying dearly for his political opportunism and bad policies.
Actually, that is better than any rate I get.

He said that deregulatrion was brought to us by Senator Peace and the Wilson administration, but that the market is very different now than it was in 1996.
He said he believes in competition, but that the problems in the market must be fixed.

Jeff, the quick scoop on Larry Drivon is that he is a graduate of Stanford and and San Francisco Law School.?
He's from Stockton and a former San Joaquin County DA.?
He was president of the California Trial Lawyers Association (now California Association of Consumer Attorneys) around 1990 and is currently chairman of the board of trustees of Humphreys School of Law in Stockton. ?
He's well known in trial lawyer circles, and has been a leader in CTLA/CAOC for years.?
I'm sure that includes working hard to raise funds for atttorney-backed initiatives (including insurance issues) and candidates.? ?
I'll try to get some more substantive info ASAP. ?

Astronomical damage awards set a bad precedent ?
by JIM LAFFERTY ? ?
?Saturday, November 13, 1999 ?
MODESTO, Calif. - Now high is up?
That's the question that thousands of giddy personal injury lawyers are asking themselves in the wake, of two astronomical punitive damage awards handed out by California juries within three days of each other in July.
Going slightly over the speed limit on an interstate highway, Romo attempted illegally to pass another vehicle on the right.
When the other driver decided to move back into the right lane, Romo swerved left and rolled over.
His mother, father and brother were killed; he and his two sisters survived.
The $290 million judgment in the Romo case was the second largest ever entered against a U.S. car manufacturer, yet it received little media attention outside the immediate Modesto area.
Hardly surprising, perhaps, since only three days before a Las Angeles jury had set the punitive damage bar impossibly high by ordering General Motors to pay a staggering punitive damage award of $4.9 billion.
By way of a yardstick, that amount surpasses the combined Gross National Product of Afghanistan and Albania.
Almost obscured by the astonishing generosity of the jurors in Los Angeles and Modesto, was a salient point that still sends shivers through corporate defense lawyers around the country: By any objective criteria, neither Ford nor General Motors appeared to bear any responsibility for the accidents.
In the Los Angeles case, Patricia Anderson, her four children and a family friend were stopped at a red light in her 1979 Chevy Malibu on Christmas Eve 1993.
A drunken driver traveling at 70 mph slammed his car into the Malibu's rear end.
The collision ruptured the Malibu's gas tank and ignited the spilled fuel.
Mrs. Anderson's four children suffered severe burns.
When police tested the drunken driver he registered a blood alcohol content of 0.20 - twice the legal limit for drivers in California.
Similarly, in the Modesto case, driver error and misjudgment on the part of Romo clearly appeared to be the cause of the accident.
Yet the Bronco exceeded all federal safety standards for roof strength in 1978 by more than 100 percent and, in fact, exceeds the 1999 standard by more than 30 percent.
Romo's Bronco also exceeded all federal rollover standards for 1978 model., and federal accident data show the Ford Broncos rollover rate was no higher than that of other SUVs.
It's open to question whether the Bronco had been properly maintained prior to the accident.
The vehicle had been on the road for 15 years, had numerous changes in ownership and had nearly 200,000 miles on the odometer.
In the book, Drivon devotes an entire chapter to Ford's alleged misdeeds.
In part because of Drivon's behavior, a California judge granted Ford's motion to set aside the punitive damage part of the verdict and ordered a new trial.
Among other things, he cited improper discussions among the jurors that prejudiced deliberations.
But Ford could be entering double jeopardy with a new trial.
Drivon has indicated he will seek to raise the initial punitive award threefold to more than $1 billion.
With a sympathetic jury, that could happen.
Damage award, of a few hundred million here and a few hundred million there are still unusual, but California is a national trendsetter.
If juries elsewhere start emulating the ones in Los Angeles and Modesto, our now booming economy could well begin to sputter. ?
Jim Lafferty is a former Associated Press and Philadelphia Daily News reporter who now covers national and international Legal trends as an independent journalist in Washington.

The Modesto jury awarded $295 million to three children whose parents and brother died when their 1978 Ford Bronco rolled over in a highway accident.
The verdict included $290 million in punitive damages - the second largest punitive award ever against an automaker.
The defense argued that the drivers of the two vehicles - not the company - were responsible for the tragedy.
But a 12-person jury found the automaker 78% liable for the deaths, concluding that Ford chose to save money by opting for a less sturdy roof design.
The jury divided the remaining liability between the two drivers.
Lawyers for neither the plaintiff nor the defendant could be reached for comment.
This story is based on local newspaper and wire stories from the time of the verdict.
Bronco Rolls Over On June 20, 1993, 19-year-old Juan Romo was driving five other family members home to northern California when he attempted to pass a van on the right at approximately 50 mph.
The van's driver didn't see Romo and changed lanes at the same time, forcing Romo to swerve hard to the right to avoid him.
Juan and his two sisters - Evangelina, 14, and Maria, 8 - suffered only minor injuries.
Plaintiffs' attorney Joseph Carcione Jr. told The Modesto Bee that the sisters survived because they weren't wearing their seatbelts and were thrown from the Bronco.
According to a press release, Carcione described the roof as a camper top.
The plaintiffs' attorneys also contended that the Bronco was unsafe because it was prone to rollover.
The vehicle's rollover rate is three to five times higher than any other passenger car and its rollover death rate is almost three times greater than the 1980-1996 model Broncos, they say in a press release.
Feeney gave additional testimony that in the 27 years he had worked for the company, the Bronco was the worst vehicle Ford ever put out in terms of crashworthiness.
Ford countered that the Bronco was perfectly sound and met all federal safety standards, noting that Feeney had "never worked in truck product development."
Defense attorneys also argued that Romo was at fault, and that his right-hand passing maneuver was illegal.
They contended that the van's driver was also partly to blame.
They noted after the trial that the $296 million award amounts to only 10 days worth of Ford's net profits.
Drivon, partner in a four-lawyer firm in Stockton, Calif., also called the Bronco the most dangerous vehicle Ford ever made.
"The American public is waking up to the carnage that's being visited upon the public by some American industries such as tobacco and automobiles," he told the Associated Press.
New Trial Pending Following the verdict, defense attorneys asked for a mistrial claiming that Romo's counsel made inflammatory public statements supporting the $4.9 billion GM verdict, which came down while jurors in his own case were still in deliberations.
The motion was denied.
Ford appealed, and on Sept. 15, the trial judge ordered a new trial on punitives, finding that the case was tainted by juror misconduct.
Beauchesne said the two jurors' comments may have influenced the deliberations and noted that the jury vote on punitive damages was 9-3, the exact majority needed.
The Wall Street Journal reported that Carcione said he's "delighted" to try the case again.
"Reversing the $290 million award was no victory for Ford.
The next jury will award even higher damages," said Carcione in a press release.
"Four of the jurors in the last trial wanted to assess punitive damages at a billion dollars or more.
The $290 million amount was reached as a compromise."
Drivon echoed Carcione's thoughts.
While Ford expressed its gratitude at the new punitives trial, it may appeal the compensatory damage award as well as the jury's finding of liability.
According to wire reports, Drivon advised Ford not to celebrate prematurely.
"The best they get out of this is that they're exposed to the verdict of a second jury," he told the Associated Press.

According to the LA TImes, we know the SEC has launched a preliminary investigation into whether Davis administration staff used inside information to buy stock.
In that case, it's a big question whether proprietary information not available to the public was properly safeguarded.
I think this is further evidence that the information requeted from Enron by the CA State Senate could be in similar jeopardy.

Gray Davis with regard to California's electricity crisis.
The governor has scored some nice publicity by switching on some new power plants.
The weather has been unseasonably cool.
His poll numbers are edging back up.
Yet beneath this optimistic picture lie troubling problems.
For example, Davis's argument that out-of-state power generators are responsible for the electricity crisis has been falling apart.
For months, Davis has been claiming that private generators have overcharged California by $8.9 billion and demanded that this amount be refunded to the state.
The chief judge thinks not."
Davis's position, as usual, is motivated purely by politics.
Davis responded to this revelation in typical political fashion.
Yet, for all Davis' feigned indignation about consumers being ripped off, it turns out that he and his regulators are poised to ensure that business consumers are ripped off by state government.
This is especially important to Davis since the high prices are borne disproportionately by business.
No matter how much Davis points the finger, Californians are paying dearly for his political opportunism and bad policies.
Beginning tomorrow, we will be using a different bridge line number.
The reason for this being that AT&T offers Enron a lower rate of $.19/cents a minute vs. $.24/cents a minute.

Dear Friends and Colleagues, This note is to inform you that I have joined El Paso Merchant Energy in their Global LNG Division reporting to Rob Bryngelson, Managing Director, Business Development.
Please note my new contact information below.
If you have received this email in error please notify the sender.
Got calls in to Richard at PG&E and Reed at Sempra.
Can you guys look into (quietly) the perspectives of the three utilities on the FERC decision?
It would be interesting to know especially about the question of refunds?
Other parties perspectives would also be helpful.
Let me know if you have a set meeting schedule.
I'll be in Portland tomorrow.
You have some time to sit and discuss a bit?
See you at 11.
I have reserved Mt.

They were a part of the discussion with Dave.
Let me know if you have a set meeting schedule.
I'll be in Portland tomorrow.
You have some time to sit and discuss a bit?
There is a serious effort currently underway in California to unseat Senator Burton (D-San Francisco), President Pro Tem.
Alarcon has already stated that he would not accept the position.
Additionally, behind the scenes, things are looking very grim for California due the implications of Direct Access.
The biggest opponent of Direct Access comes from the Governor's office as they realize the potential effects of direct access and how it could undermine the revenue stream supporting the bond issuance.
I want to work on it through the evening.
Will make sure that it's out tonite, well in advance of tomorrow's 1 PM PDT conference call.

[FERC PRESS RELEASE] ADD - FERC Staff did a great job on preparing a detailed analysis of the market issues.
Please let me know if I've misconstrued anything.
FERC got a lot right in the order and we're very encouraged as a result.
In particular, ending the PX buy/sell requirement and permitting utilities to manage risk through a portfolio of short and long term contracts is a fundamental step in the right direction.
However, the proposed price cap is unworkable and will jeopardize realibility in California.
As structured, it will: discourage the development of new generation to serve California fail to provide adequate incentives for demand responsiveness.
force Enron to abandon 300 MWs of new power projects planned for California.
We look forward to participating in FERC's process and are hopeful that FERC's final order will fix the deficiencies in the current price cap proposal.
We encourage California to work with FERC to implement the proposals and quickly fix the flaws in the market on behalf of the state's consumers.

Will make sure that it's out tonite, well in advance of tomorrow's 1 PM PDT conference call.
Approximately 120 people were in attendance.
Before her remarks, it was announced that Ken Lay had postponed his Town Hall engagement.
Adrienne Medawar (Town Hall President) said she was very disappointed but that Mr. Lay was committed to rescheduling at a later date.
Lynch provided a brief overview of electricity regulation in California and the Federal Power Act.
After denouncing the "blame game" and stating that she had been on the receiving end of a coordinated attempt to assign blame, Lynch proceeded to place blame on former Gov.
Wilson, the 1996 legislature that adopted AB 1890, FERC, and merchant generators and sellers.
Lynch discussed 5 myths of deregulation: #1.
California deregulated its system in 1996.
Lynch stated that California did not deregulate, rather that California federalized electricity prices.
Despite market manipulation, FERC failed to enforce the law.
This resulted in the largest transfer of wealth in US history.
California's problem is simply a lack of supply.
Lynch showed charts depicting the amount of supply off-line last December.
Long term contracts would have solved the problem.
The facts prove this wrong.
Since Jan. 2000, only 10 requests were made for contract authority.
Rushing to long-term contracting could prove to be quite costly.
Over contracting may lead to excess supply.
Forward contracting also prohibits initiatives such as direct access.
Early rate increases would have solved the problem.
The PUC raised rates when it was demonstrated that it was necessary and did so within 90 days.
#5 Sellers will exercise self control.
All evidence points to the contrary.
California deregulation was designed in speculator's interest.
Prices went down only because of FERC action.
High prices demonstrate the need for government regulation in cartel situation.
Lynch offered the following suggestions to fix and improve the current situation: 1.
Expand renewable energy and energy efficiency 2.
Forge a relationship with the "new" FERC 3.
Hold those who broke the rules accountable 4.
Make sure there is adequate supply at reasonable prices Questions from audience: Is it true that DWR will be able to set rates?
Yes, AB1X transferred PUC's role of evaluating reasonableness to the DWR.
PUC cannot disallow pass through of costs.
Will state intervention remove incentive of private business to invest in California's electricity market?
The facts bear that theory out as a red herring.
Even with $250 price cap in place, many companies applied for permits to build power plants.
What legal recourse do we have?
PUC has joined with the Attorney General to investigate generators and sellers.
"I believe they stepped over the line.
They were sloppy about it."
We've been thwarted by confidentiality agreements, but justice will prevail.
Otherwise, it'll land in your email later tonite.
My apologies for all the machinations.
To explain, I left the sheet you saw previously as Sheet 1.
Sheet 2 is the new employee and business expense budget.
It shows expenditures through 7/09/01 in the first column, our 2001 budget in the second column, and a proposed 2002 budget in the third column.
Some of the expenditures are kind of kooky -- because of miscoding or other reasons.
There are many examples of kooky things -- so don't worry about it.
I included those wacky categories that we don't use in our budget at the bottom of column 1 just to get the correct total for the year to date.
Sheet 3 is outside expenses such as contributions, retainers and memberships.
Column 1 shows our 2001 budget and column 3 shows our projected 2002 budget.
I added some dollars to the retainers to cover some minimal expenses that we get charged.
Other than that, it's pretty much what we discussed last week.
Call with any questions.
The attachments consist of the Report (in Word format) and two Appendices (in Excel format).
It's getting in the way of the positive message, and the math turns out to be a bit "Goreish."
(read: fuzzy) I found myself wandering down all sorts of blind alleys in my spin to Dow Jones.
I say we generalize it more.
Something to the effect of "The price caps send the wrong message to the marketplace.
Whether it's gas lines in the seventies or bread lines in the old Soviet Union, price caps and market intervention cause problems."
 Possible follow up questions or additions (2a) If you feel you were evaluated unfairly, do you feel comfortable voicing your concern?
(1) If there is a significant age difference between you and your manager, was the issue ever openly discussed?
(4) Do you feel that your perfromance was influenced by the age difference between you and your supervisor?
All the time sometimes rarely (6) Leaving/turnover: If you were to or did leave your job, how much would you attribute to the age difference between you and your supervisor?
much <--- little (7) To what extent would you say your manager encourages your career growth through educational and new work opportunities?
I reviewed the UtilityGuide website and while I do not have an issue with Mr. van Ulden participating on the advisory board I would have a few cautions.
It should not include any hard commitments from Enron in terms of funding.
We may want to participate in the program but we should not be required too.
His compensation should be insignificant or nothing.
Otherwise he would have a conflict as their revenues will come from our competitors.
I would have a lot of heartburn over that as an Enron representative as well as if I came from the competition.
Please let me know final status or if you have any questions.
UtilityGuide's goal is to create an online forum for buyers and sellers of deregulated energy services.
Mr. van Ulden would be one of seven on the advisory board, which does not include any management activities.
Mr. van Ulden's main duties appear to be assisting in recruitment of other members of the advisory board, other management members, and identifying potential sources of working capital.
The term of Mr. van Ulden's appointment would be one year.
However, because of EES' ongoing forays into the electronic marketplace, we thought it appropriate to ask your thoughts before responding.
I believe that Mr. van Ulden has the concurrence of his management as to this appointment, although of course we can seek concurrence from any other management entities deemed necessary or prudent.
Your input would be greatly appreciated.
Pls let me know if I can provide any further information.

 THE FRIDAY BURRITO "...more fun than a fortune cookie, and at least as accurate."
=01&Are those folks smoking crack?=018 he asked in an outrage.
My friend, = Ol=01, Dave in Houston, has trouble understanding the workings of our power business here in California.
=01&Come to think of it, Dave, they did say something about that.
I can=01,t remember if that was before or after he suggested to EOB Chairman Kahn that the ISO and the PX should be folded into State agencies under the direction of the Electric Oversight Board.=018 I know what you are thinking right now.
The next thing you know California will have regulated retail rates.
That recipe should be out of the PUC=01,s oven sometime next week.
=01&Well, the power marketers are jigging the system, bidding up to the ISO=01,s bid cap.
There is no way you can tell me that a generator planned to make $750/MWH in its pro forma,=018 Dave added.
=01&So you agree with Herr (Hair) Peace!
You don=01,t believe in markets,=018 I retorted.
=01&I didn=01,t want to= show him my position.
You get hosed when you show the buyer your position.
Ask for 50, first,=018 Dave chided.
I said I= =01,d take it, and then said I needed another fifty.
I took that, and he priced the next 50 MW at $600,=018 lamented Dave.
=01&He just wanted to see how far he could push me.
The traders are the in between people who guess at the price.
Sometimes they guess right, and sometimes they guess wrong.
But the damage, or the reward, is on their book, not passed on to the ultimate consumer.
It has nothing to do with the marginal cost of a generating plant.=018 And there you have it.
Put in a price cap, and the traders have a target for which to shoot.
Consumers get hosed, and the fundamental economic principle is upheld, which is, one can never be made better off with the imposition of an additional constraint.
I feel better already.
Here is what is on our short agenda this week.
Here is what my friends have been writing me.
Is this the year you get the AARP letter???
A very depressing moment.
Do you really not know how to spell Morro Bay???
Please let us know what is going on with your son's hockey team??
Don't forget the cigars for Moron???
!=018 It is good to have friends like Steve.
They make the pain of separation so much easier.
I want to participate in the name selection for the new entity.
Though you are usually neutral regarding the PX, you are not unduly negative which I appreciate.
I think we do a pretty good job over here and so often people in the industry forget the amount effort and challenge it took the PX to successfully open this market.=018 Thanks, Mark.
I just want you to know that my ability to write this stuff every week is not constrained by the facts or evidence.
I have learned from watching Herr (Hair?)
=01&Just curious - has anyone been comparing high unleaded prices to high CA electricity prices?
What I mean is, we are up in arms about how we should protect the unfortunate San Diego consumer who can't afford to keep the AC on.
But what about the inflated unleaded gas prices the whole country has seen over the last few months?
No effort is made by the government to shield the consumer from how much it costs to fill their gas tank.
No mention is made of those who can't afford to drive to the grocery store because they can't afford the extra 15 or 20 cents a gallon.
The costs are passed along to the consumer without pause.
I too noted that the "speak fast" was applied to everyone but Herr Peace.
My goodness, what a mess we have.
I loved Jerry's picture in USA Today -- it spoke volumes.
I decided to excerpt the best sections of it for the Burrito.
The full document can be found on the ISO=01,s website.
=01&... the [PUC/EOB] Report asserts that the suspected activities of certain generators on June 13 created frequency instability leading to the Bay Area blackouts the following day.
In fact, the events of June 13 and June 14 were completely independent of one another.
The voltage instability on June 14 was caused by system conditions on that day alone -- exceptionally high loads, insufficient generation in the specific local area, and transmission constraints that prevented the import of generation from outside the area.
$= 1.2 billion in the month of June alone).
These assertions leave one with the mistaken impression that these prices reflect amounts actually paid by the UDCs and/or passed through to customers.
However, in determining the total cost of energy, one must determine the impact of any forward contracts entered into by the UDCs in advance of the wholesale energy markets.
We have reason to believe that some of the UDCs were substantially hedged during the period of the recent price spikes.
This assertion assumes that all energy purchases would have been made at or below the $250 bid cap.
The Market Surveillance Committee has noted that =01&market power in the California energy market appears to arise primarily during periods of peak demand,=018 and warned that demand growth would increase the incidence of market power during the summer of 2000.
=01&The Report asserts that the ISO is answerable only to a self-interested board and not to the citizens of California.
This simply is not the case.
The ISO is subject to the provisions of the Federal Power Act and to the rules and regulations of FERC, which dictate, in part, that wholesale energy rates must be just and reasonable and in the public interest.
The ISO further operates under a detailed tariff reviewed and approved by FERC.
Every change to our market design and virtually every aspect of the ISO=01,s business is subject to review and scrutiny by FERC.
The FERC process provides substantial opportunities for input by the state agencies and such agencies have, in fact, been active participants in the FERC proceedings.
=01&The Report asserts that California supply conditions have been affected by restructuring and that somehow the restructuring choices have made California more vulnerable to supply shortages.
This assertion is unfounded.
Significant load growth in California and neighboring states coupled with a lack of significant infrastructure investment in both generation and transmission have caused this vulnerability.
Restructuring has increased proposed power plant applications many fold.
Also imagine, as if you are in the Twilight Zone, witnesses that are slow on their feet, and reckless in their facts.
Then you get a glimpse of what yesterday=01,s Joint Senate/Assembly hearing was like.
It started over two hours late.
The Senate was busy congratulating one of their own who is term-limited out next session, and they wanted to heap on the glory.
That said, the show began with CEC Commissioner Bill Keese.
It is the heat storm story.
They are searching for electric power plants in the dessert, which, by the grace of God have been shipped to other countries which have more liberal returns on investment.
Being the first speaker, Mr. Keese took at least half the heat (storm) of the day.
The rage of the Energy Fuhrer was palpable.
Last week, San Diegans shed 350 MW of load last week to save the entire system, and did not receive one penny of compensation (I=01,m not making that up ...
He is sick of hearing about demand management as being a solution for the problem over the last five years, and he is about done listening.
People in San Diego are depressed by the sudden price hikes.
Mr. Keese correctly pointed out that electric power is not solely a California problem, it is a regional problem.
One member of the Committee asked what the legislature could do to speed up the power plant siting and construction process?
The six months are enough if the applicant has the land secured, zoning okayed, transmission access, and air offsets.
That alone might take six months before you get to the CEC.
The next panel included Mr. Kahn of the EOB, and Ms. Lynch.
I went too hard on her last week, calling her Let=01,s Do Lynch.
That was a 0.8 TPC.
I promise to be nicer starting now.
The Energy Fuhrer instructed Ms. Lynch to use her authority to order SDG&E to divert the pass through of funds from the customers to the PX until the dysfunction of the market is cured.
Put it in an escrow account.
Ms Lynch promised to review this option at her August 21 PUC Meeting where she will enact SDG&E rate caps (told you).
The star of the day, I thought, was FERC General Counsel Doug Smith.
Mr. Smith comes to Sacramento.
Mr. Smith came in place of Mr. Hoecker, thank the Lord.
Mr. Smith put into FERC-eese what these 12 legislators could not get through their heads any other way.
The 12 angry legislators were looking for a way for FERC to declare the wholesale market as non-competitive, and then ask the generators to give back the money they over collected.
When can we do that?
Mr. Smith answered as only a FERC attorney can answer.
There is a process.
You must have evidence.
FERC uses a three-part criteria for assessing whether or not market based rates are allowable.
It=01,s based on market concentration and dominance, not the existence of high prices.
You would have to sue FERC in federal court, and the best you could hope for is for FERC to reconsider its decision upon remand from the US Court of Appeals.
Slowly, the wind came out of the sails of the gang of 12.
Like a wheezing accordion, Mr. Smith played back and forth the familiar strains of music, like a solo street musician on the corner.
Back and forth: the process, the process, the process.
There have been times in the past I hated the process at FERC.
Today, I have a renewed respect for what process affords me and you ... Freedom from the tyranny of a mob.
For the remainder of the hearing, they focused on remedies that could be undertaken by the PUC.
I like my title better.
This Order, or OII was issued at the last business meeting of the Commission, on August 3.
It calls for an investigation of the wholesale markets, responses from the three UDCs, and a pre-hearing conference in San Diego on August 29 at the San Diego Convention Center.
Here are the questions the PUC wishes us to address: =01=07 What bill payment options should be provided to assist residential a= nd small commercial customers?(What does this have to do with the functioning of the wholesale market?)
=01=07 Should SDG&E be authorized to participate in bilateral contracts or other supply procurement activities?
How should the Commission assess reasonableness?
Are SDG&E=01,s purchasing activities serving its customers on just and reasonable terms?
=01=07 What is SDG&E=01,s obligation to minimize energy costs for its curre= nt customers?
How should state/federal concerns be addressed?
=01=07 What are the causes of the price increases?
Are anticompeititve practices causing some of the price increases?
Are there mechanisms the Commission can employ to make ratepayers whole?

She didn=01,t have to attend the Senate hearing.
Subject: The Brilliance of Women There were 11 people hanging onto a rope that came down from a helicopter.
Ten were men and one was a woman.
They all decided that one person should get off because if they didn't the rope would break and everyone would die.
No one could decide who should go so finally the Woman gave a really touching speech saying how she would give up her life to save the others, because women were used to giving up things for their husbands and children and giving in to men.
All of the men started clapping.
Each of you were very helpful providing information in response to our questions.
We appreciate your patience through the revision of our annual report.
Further, as requested, we will include a 1998 bill that notifies customers that their rates were reflective of the 1.5 cents p/kwh customer credit.
Again, we greatly appreciate your kind assistance.
THE FRIDAY BURRITO "...more fun than a fortune cookie, and at least as accurate."
There is a hint of Autumn in the air.
I don=01,t know if it=01,s wishful thinking, or if the seasons are really beginning to turn from our pale summer into a Bay Area glorious Fall.
It=01,s premature, I know.
A few fallen leaves, the start of schools, slightly longer afternoon shadows ... I=01,m jumping the gun.
I can=01,t wait for this summer to be over, especially this summer.
I also get the willies every time another politician lambastes the California restructured power industry.
I just want to end to the summer, now, and start a two week Fall vacation ... anywhere, even in Cleveland.
There are seven, count them, seven investigations into some aspect of the wholesale power market out here.
Two days ago there were only six, but FERC just added another yesterday in response to the Prez=01,s request.
If you don=01,t have an ongoing study of the California Market, then you=01,re not hip.
All of these investigations, save FERC=01,s Section 206 Investigation, are going to amount to near nothing.
A lot of wasted time and paper.
The PUC and EOB studies have their conclusion sections all finished.
Now they need some evidence to support their assertions.
And how are we holding up under all of this?
I talk to many of you throughout the week, and I know how frustrated you are.
I share your frustration.
You want to tell the public, the press, and anyone in between the truth.
You want to lay out the facts.
You want to show anyone who will listen that each interference into the market is making things worse, not better.
The price caps, for example, are damnable and screwing up the prices, much to the detriment of those people for who price caps were supposed to be a protection against price shocks.
Now they are receiving higher average prices.
The public isn=01,t going to listen to anything longer than a sound bite.
Those guys seem to get their story in front of the public at every turn.
Keep your head down, shut your mouth, and this too shall pass.
I don=01,t buy that approach, at least not anymore.
That is, I don=01,t believe we have anything to hide, or of which to be ashamed.
What electric restructuring is about is correct, beneficial to the public, and in everyone=01,s best interests.
Look at it this way, when they pat the last shovelful of dirt on your final resting place, for what do you most want to be remembered?
That you caved in to the political will of others, or at a moment when you had the chance, you did what was right instead of what was expedient?
I think the choice is easy, albeit laced with sheer terror.
So join me and stand up for what you believe.
They can=01,t take away your pride, not yet.
Here is this week=01,s line up.
I call this the Del Monica Beach lecture.
The Prez instructed the FERC to investigate the situation in California, and FERC wasted no time.
The FERC slammed SDG&E on their complaint for lack of merit, and the FERC also initiated an FPA Section 206 Investigation into the wholesale power market in California.
SDG&E also argues that the hour-to-hour volatility in imbalance energy prices and the erratic clearing price for ancillary services is an indication that the market is breaking down when it is moderately stressed.
Nor did it address specific market or institutional factors that may be causing rates to be unjust or unreasonable.
=01&SDG&E asserts that the ISO's congestion management and market structures are flawed and in need of overhaul.
=01&Various interveners contend that SDG&E's arguments are premature.
... We agree with Interveners.
The reform efforts have been the subject of extensive public review and comment and are nearing completion.
Accordingly, we reject SDG&E's arguments at this time.
=01&It is unclear whether SDG&E's failure to purchase hedging instruments for its retail operations is due to state regulatory policies or its business decisions.
A retail rate design that exposes consumers to the volatility of commodity prices would be extraordinary, particularly when consumers do not have the ability to receive or respond to price signals.
=01&We are concerned that ... increasing level of market activity in the real-time market raises significant reliability and economical concerns.
Historically, the ISO procures on a daily basis only the resources needed for the operating day.
Not only does this procurement practice put pressure on the grid operator to secure needed resources at the last minute, but the practice is uneconomical.
Such spot-market purchases are not subject to the ISO's buyer's cap.
=01&In an effort to address this problem, we direct the ISO to immediately institute a more forward approach to procuring the resources necessary to reliably operate the grid.
Specifically, the ISO should anticipate the need for such additional resources based on forecasted peak periods.
I challenged them to let the market participants develop this market instead of the ISO doing the same.
The ISO reported that this summer, to date, the amount of money spent on Out of Market purchases was about $100 million.
Last year the total cost of Out of Market purchases was $1.7 million.
APX and CalPX, in response to our earlier discussions with them, presented their proposals at the meeting.
There were no commitments made by any party, simply a willingness to work together to alleviate the problems associated with finding sufficient electric power during high demand periods with greater transparency, more participants, and greater market efficiency.
We=01,ll keep you posted on our development of this market.
 The Mailbag: A Letter from My Friend, and A Response Sometimes I share bites of our Burrito with fellow travellers, much as I did last week when I sent my friend Mike Florio a copy of the story called the Trial of Gow Jing.
Mike sent me a note that I would like to share.
He said I could.
I want you to read it and appreciate that there are other people who share his view.
I also copied the response I sent to Michael, a.k.a.
In simpler times, people knew the other people that they did business with, and they typically lived in the same community.
If a merchant tried to charge exorbitant prices for his products, even if he was the only one in town who had the product in stock, he would face the wrath of his fellow citizens.
This undoubtedly served as a constraint on such behavior, even in the absence of a CPUC or FERC.
Telling Mrs. Jones that the loaf of bread she needs to feed her kids will cost her $50 would not be a pleasant way to do business, and such things ordinarily did not happen.
=01&In the modern global economy, of course, this personal aspect of doing business has been almost completely lost.
And so has the restraint.
I have no doubt that the folks who sell electricity are good people (jeez, I know many of them), but they work in an environment where the end results of their business decisions are invisible.
=01&This is clearly not a case of socialism versus capitalism, because both scenarios occur within the overall context of a capitalist system.
But certainly something fundamental has changed, and not for the better in my view.
Now everyone feels compelled to squeeze the last dollar out of every transaction-- their jobs may even depend upon it-- and no one is responsible for the end result.
Is this the kind of world we want to live in???
=01&PUT THAT IN YOUR BURRITO AND SEE WHAT YOUR READERS SAY!
It=01,s in the Burrito.
And here is what I think.
You allude to the change in a world that was once =01&more personal=018 and= is now institutional.
You make the point that things are not better off if for no other reason then the lack of personal accountability.
But I don=01,t think that in all cases the more personal world is lost.
It is ever present, as I will argue below.
Second, your group embraces the impersonal =01&efficiencies=018 when it is convenient.
Finally and most importantly, where will your social-minded and like minded counterparts be when competitive forces leap supply ahead of demand, which might happen in a handful of years?
However, your essential point is not lost on me.
I do believe that there are ways for generators and consumers to be good neighbors in California.
I have a proposal below to which I would like to hear your response.
First, though, the personal business touch is present in our economy.
I exercise the restraint to which your story pines in many of my consulting engagements which require financial give and take between client and vendor.
It is simply smart business to do so.
I have been the beneficiary of the same with my local bank when errors occurred in my checking accounts, or when loan payments were made absent mindedly late, etc., and the late fee forgiven.
However, much of our economy, and certainly the trade of a commodity such as electricity requires the use of markets.
Nameless and faceless, they do squeeze out all the efficiencies which lead to lower prices, more innovation, and a sharing of price risk with parties who are neither the ultimate consumer nor the initial producer.
The producer and consumer get out of the risk arbitrage and leave it to others who are more skilled and monied.
Elimination of market separation is nothing more than the impersonal forcing of parties to execute trades on either side of a congested transmission path in the name of market efficiency.
Lower prices for consumers.
Does it really matter if it is done through person to person transactions, or through markets?
Third, your story can be used to make an alternative point.
What happens to the merchant in town when Wal-Mart moves into the next town down the road?
All the faithful customers that your Merchant of Vengeance was protecting suddenly migrate to a competitor with greater inventory, more choice, and lower prices.
What do you say, then?
The corollary for us is direct.
The new generation owners moved literally billions of dollars into California, at risk, and took a chance.
They succeeded as we all know this year, and probably will next year, and so on.
Consumers will reap that benefit, oh you best believe it.
But the alliances to which your opening story alludes simply misses that point.
You gotta make hay while the sun shines.
Now to my proposal.
Michael, I would be willing to work with you to develop some kind of loan program for residential and small commercial customers that would, in effect, reduce the economic hardship of higher electricity prices.
Borrowers would pay a fair interest rate and the administrative fees.
It=01,s simply smart business, not charity.
It=01,s one way to amortize th= e earnings which came about due to a circumstance of short supply relative to the sudden growth of demand for power.
Maybe that is a step in the right direction, I don=01,t know.
One could argue that it is no different than SDG&E implementing a level payment plan for it=01,s consumers.
than one instituted by a monopoly.
Second, the security for these loans is provided by parties other than the utility=01,s customers.
Further, we wouldn=01,t have to wor= ry about PUC oversight and prudence reviews.
We could make this work quickly.
I will be very interested to hear your thoughts, and the comments of my members.
Thanks for sending us your letter.
Here is what Carl said, =01&Am I missing something?
Who is Gow-Jing supposed to represent?
(Yes, I get the pun in the name.
But is he also just an anonymous "everyman" or is there someone in particular?)
Then he takes out a concealed axe, goes on a rampage and kills everyone.
But that's too realistic, so don't use that ending.
And they lived happily ever after.
We=01,ll leave the contest open for another week.
Can=01,t let $5 bucks go the only entry.
To date, 21 of the 24 rooms originally set aside in the WPTF block are now taken.
Among the additional rooms, there are 2 rooms blocked with double beds on Wed. & Thur.
nights at $152.00 each and 6 rooms on both nights for $89.00 each.
Folks, you better call the Inn at Morro Bay, telephone 800-321-9566.
Rooms should be requested under the name of the Western Power Trading Forum.
Also feel free to call the Inn and book a room for Friday and Saturday if you wish to stay over....ask for SHAWN.
For those who are in the golf, green fees are $28.00 plus $10.00 for the cart.
I must have an accurate headcount.
Dan Douglass of Arter and Hadden sent us the following item.
Houston, the unofficial home of the electric power industry, is a town you either love or hate.
Here are some guiding principles offered by the Chamber of Commerce of the 4th largest city to enable their many visitors to cope.
=01=07 First you must learn to pronounce the city name.
It is YEWS-TUN a= nd it does not matter how people pronounce it in other places.
=01=07 Forget the traffic rules you learned elsewhere.
Houston has its ow= n version of traffic rules.
Never forget that downtown Houston is composed entirely of one way streets.
The only way to get out of center of town is to turn around and start over when you reach Dallas, Texas.
=01=07 All directions start with, "Go down Westheimer..." =01=07 Westheimer has no beginning and no end.
=01=07 It's impossible to go around a block and wind up on the street yo= u started on.
The Chamber of Commerce calls this a "scenic drive".
=01=07 The 8am rush hour is from 6:30 to 9:30am.
The 5:00 pm rush hour is from 3:30 to 6:30 pm.

Jeff: You are quite correct about the facts of the arrangement.
In both situations, our hours were required by the expanded press of the work in the hearing, and the uncertainty that is involved in estimating the cost of hearing work is always difficult to deal with.
I unable to plead anything other than brain disfunction as to why I agreed with your numbers, which I knew would be too low.
So here we are.
That would mean you would pay $19,761 of the current balance.
On that basis, we would prepare written comments and lobby for the proposed decision when it comes out at no additional cost.
I think either solution is fair to both sides.
If you want me to explain the situation to Paul or Rick or Steffes in order to assist in justifying the additional expense, I would be more than happy to do so.
Thank you, and I mean this sincerely, for considering our request for a revision of the billing arrangements.
I am also willing to get together today and talk about this face to face if you want.
As you recall, we had a very lengthy discussion regarding the magnitude of the work associated with the hearings and associated briefs.
With that in mind, I believe that it's important to honor the arrangement.
If you'd like to discuss it further, I'd be happy to talk about it.
I prefer the $15,000/clean slate option.

Payment of that amount will completely clear your account.
We will not perform any more work on the file until the proposed decision is issued, and at that time, we will perform all work which you and I agree upon on an hourly fee basis.
Thank you for your cooperation.

PLEASE NOTE MY NEW E-MAIL ADDRESS.
AS PART OF CORP.
I have not received any e-mails from most of you for TWO WEEKS.
SO, if you asked me a question and I didn't respond, you know why.
Please fix...
I have scheduled a conference call for Wednesday October 18 at 1:30 p.m. central time to discuss our strategy relating to the CPUC investigation.
Update on conversations with CPUC attorneys (Fergus and Day) 2.
Update on status of other companies' responses to CPUC subpoena 3.
Assignment of tasks to be accomplished
and what we'd like to do going forward.
They'll then put together a plan and we can get them on retainer by Nov. 1.
What other agencies do we have on retainer?
(McNally Temple, the guy who did the focus groups, etc.)
Do you know what their monthly retainer is?
I'd like to get a sense of what we're already spending.
Looking forward to seeing you Monday.
It's about a new hire in my group and I wanted advice.
Easier to talk in person though.
Maybe I'll see you tonight?
i have a finance midterm and will be at your place around 10 or 10:15, most likely.
be happy to chat.
i can't believe those fins.
Easier to talk in person though.

The inequities that you are referring to in #4 is that the cap be applied both to bundled service and d/a customers, right?
We will have to do this strategically to avoid negative consequences.
Work with PG&E and SCE on developing a post-freeze solution at the legislature to recover undercollections over a 5 year period in order to facilitate an acceptable solution.
Watch and prevent adverse changes to how the PX credit is calculated.
Just a reminder - there's only a couple more hours left to vote in this round of the HaasWeek Survivor contest.

Ed, 11/1/00.... ps.
Steve asked me to forward this to you.
(Did I get anything right????!!!!)
We can say though, that instead of blaming generators and marketers the report blames the structure of the market for California's woes.
I think we should shorten the quote to something like " the reprt is consistent with what we have said all along.
We should say that the scheduling penalties part of the order will "penalize utilities for underscheduling" not predicting.
Hedging is not about holding pirces down so much as it is about protecting people from wild price swings ... that's what allowing utilities to buy outside the spot should help do.
Please read it over and let me have comments tomorrow morning (Thursday).
it goes live 5 p.m. Thursday evening.
Sorry for AOL -- my Notes is wreaking havoc today.
(Jeff -- Steve confirmed that the report said power sellers did not exercise market power or price gouging, so I put it in the article.)
Take care, Jeannie (See attached file: FERC Report.doc) - FERC Report.doc
Attached is a ruling just issued by Commissioner Duque with regard to the SCE and PG&E emergency petitions for modification concerning the end of the rate freeze decisions.?
(Interestingly, the version sent out shows redlining from an earlier draft.
The most interesting change was the deletion of the sentence, "Nevertheless, the accounting modifications contemplated are all that we can reasonably resolve in the remaining four Commission meeting dates left in year 2000.")? ?
Duque reiterates a commitment to reaching a final decision on accounting issues by the end of the year.?
The TURN proposal will obviously get primary attention. ?
Such an OII will offer an appropriate forum for addressing this issue in a comprehensive way, and it will provide an opportunity to develop a full record on this matter." ?
See you at the Alaska gate.
Lets go with what we have.
We'll need to update the numbers for the offer we made to S.D.
You had mentioned that you might want to include a shaped product.
Let us know and we can add it, and make any other changes you'd like to make at this end.
My flight gets into S.D.
at at 8:35 on southwest.
FYI--I'll be participating on the second panel.
Attached is your personal sheet for next week and the results so far.

Everything that I heard was that there wasn't anything to gain by attending this dinner.
I therefore assume that we did not give the $$.
My current thoughts are that if we want to give to Gov.
Davis, let's give directly.
Also, are we thinking about meeting with the Gov's key energy people and legislative members to share our perspective on the FERC Order.
I personally think the answer should be we're done with political donations to the Governor for 2000.
I don't see any marginal gain for the investment.
Perhaps we can discuss further as part of our meeting on Monday.
We have already received firm commitments from 3 companies.
If you are interested in attending please e-mail me as soon as possible.
A formal invitation will follow to those who respond.
We need responses or direction by no later than COB on Monday, October 30, 2000.
Please contact me with any questions.

Please find attached a short memorandum concerning the "Cross-Border Opportunities" group.
As you will note in the memo, Aleck has proposed that the group have its first conference call on Friday, January 21st 2-4 p.m. CST.
Please let me know you can participate in that call I will circulate the call-in details shortly.
Sam asked me to put together some points on the ISO, PX and the FERC Order.
If you have comments, let us know asap.
(See attached file: Sam Wehn Points.doc) - Sam Wehn Points.doc
We have to send our issue list to FERC tomorrow so please comment on this ASAP.
We should discuss price signals including: price caps and market information Here's my rationale.
Since we'll only have five to ten minutes to talk, our comments should focus on the most important commercial issues to us: removing or improving price caps and improving market transparency by providing market information to market participants.
We could summarize the positions we took in the white paper about why the Commission shouldn't allow a price cap at all and why we need information.
In addition, our written comments will want to beef up the legal support for the Staff's conclusion about refunds and perhaps request rehearing of the Commission's decision to move the refund effective date.
I'm sure we'll find more issues as we go.
Sam, I took a quick look at what Mona had done and had a few clarifying changes.
Let either of us know if you need more help.
I'm afraid we'll look greedy unless we focus strongly on the RETAIL affect of the low price cap and how raising it would ultimately allow retail customers to save money and wholesale markets to work more efficiently.
there is some stuff we can quote in the iso's market surveillance com report.
we also have some real world experience to draw upon (i'm told that FERC occasionally really likes to hear about the real world) -- we had a number of customers on demand responsiveness plans in the east and we sent them checks for BIG BUCKS this summer.
These are powerful examples of how price caps influence retail demand response.
This only goes so far, however...
The FERC could easily eliminate the problem by exempting demand side bids from the price caps.
SO, we need more...
The staff report provides some good evidence on why the caps are too low and we could also use the ISO's calculation of prices for short-term peaking capacity.
We have to send our issue list to FERC tomorrow so please comment on this ASAP.

That is more of a challenge than you might imagine in this complicated deregulated world we find ourselves in.
I believe we are making a good start.
"Having said all that, this market is dysfunctional.
It is a very difficult environment for deregulation to work.
And I repeat again, deregulation can work but only if all parties act responsibly and if the market is competitive, which it is not.
"I was pleased to see that Secretary Richardson agrees with me that this market is dysfunctional and I am also somewhat pleased by the initial reports of the action that FERC took today.
It is a mixed blessing.
They do recognize that we are operating in a dysfunctional market and they do agree that the rates are not just or reasonable.
However, they did not, as I encouraged, order rebates to the consumers and businesses in San Diego who were literally gouged and for the profiteering and market manipulation that San Diego had to suffer through.
"FERC also decided to abolish the stakeholder boards at the ISO-independent service operator, and the power exchange.
FERC agrees with me that they are self-serving and either contributed to or participated directly in market manipulation.
However, it is unclear what will replace those boards.
The good news is that they agree with our premise that the market is dysfunctional, rates are unreasonable and unjust.
The bad news is there is no immediate remedy for ratepayers here in California.
"I believe the marketplace generally makes good decisions but I am not going to be a prisoner of ideology.
I do not want some knee jerk reactions to drive our economy or our consumers to their knees.
I have seen time and again the most right wing conservatives in San Diego that say, 'please give us money to bail us out from the increased prices that have descended upon us.'
So as I have long understood, economics drives politics and at the moment we are shipping about $6 billion more out of this state for electricity than we paid about 12 months ago.
That has got to stop.
"It appears that the FERC said they are going to restructure it and this again suggestes the complexity that we have to deal with.
Once the state deregulated distribution from power generation in 1996, the PUC basically surrendered most of its control over the purchase and acquisition of electricity for California and that control reverted to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
As I read the initial reports from the FERC decision today, they are saying the ISO and the power exchange are dominated by stake holder members and they think that is ill advised, as do I.
There will be new boards established and we will tell you how they are established.
So it is unclear whether we have the authority to, independent of the FERC to establish our own ISO and power exchange.
My initial reading of the press reports suggest that we may not.
That is something that has to be cleared up over the next several days.
"We have had a series of meetings over the past two months with all kinds of stakeholders from turn to utilities to generators, other consumer groups from San Diego and we are trying to forge a consensus which will indicate the path that we will take.
I am not at the point where I can tell you what that consensus is.
But we are making progress.
"That we are going to fight for consumers, that they should not bear the full brunt of this experiment in deregulation.
At best it was premature and the market place was not prepared.
The marketplace is dysfunctional, it is not competitive.
There is a far greater demand for electricity than we can generate in this state.
I want them to know that we are working night and day to find a solution that will ensure that they are not the guinea pigs for this ill-conceived scheme.
"I am pleased that FERC has recognized that the marketplace is dysfunctional, recognized that rates are unjust and unreasonable.
I am not pleased that they have not offered any solutions.
It looks like we are going to have to wait until November 9th at the hearing in front of FERC at which their full plan will be unveiled and there will be a chance to comment, critique and modify and then thirty days after that the plan will be adopted in full or in part.
This is a very important meeting in which our administration will be fully represented and I hope to be able to inform the consumers of this state more fully at the conclusion of that meeting if not before.
"I believe refunds are due and necessary.
FERC and the Secretary of Energy have concurred with my assessment that these rates are not just and reasonable and I believe that FERC has the power to order refunds.
It is unclear whether they believe they have the power to do it or not.
Congress could settle the question by simply passing legislation to ensure that.
Over the long haul, by that I mean 5 to 10 to 15 years, I believe deregulation can work but only if we have a competitive marketplace and if all parties act responsibly.
As I told everyone involved in this process, some people may win the battle but lose the war if they insist on gouging every consumer and citizen of this state.
The people of California will stand up; they will rise up and take matters into their own hands.
The problem with deregulation lowering rates, is that we have not seen them and frankly none are on the immediate horizon.
"Let me just say two things.
I think there is plenty of blame to go around but there is no question that the generators who happen to be out-of-state companies are charging us 600 to 700% more for the very same electricity that we purchased last year.
You cannot add value to an electron.
An electron is an electron.
They are simply taking advantage of an ill-advised scheme envisioned in the 1996 act to charge what the market will bear.
I am standing up and saying no more.
We are not going to take this lying down.
We are fighting back.
The difficulty is that we do not have the power that we used to have.
The state surrendered a lot of that power when Governor Wilson signed the deregulation bill.
Actually carried by Jim Brulte and co authored by Steve Peace, they were the two driving forces as they will be happy, well maybe not so happy, to acknowledge.
It may have seemed like a good idea in 1996 but I did not participate in that debate and I don't have a comment on whether it was a good idea then.
But clearly in the year 2000 it is not a good idea.
Again our problem is we can describe the problem and we have some limited authority over the power the utilities have not yet sold off to the generators which is about 35-40% of their facilities that they used to own and we do not have control over the facilities they have sold off to the out of state generators that purchased them.
FERC has control over them and it is unclear whether we even have control to establish our own ISO and our own power exchange and if we did I would have them reconstituted.
There is no question about that.
They are too self serving too inbred and too incestuous and do not represent consumer interests.
Plus you cannot hold anyone accountable there is no one public official on any one of those boards.
You cannot hold anyone accountable and they determine largely what the price of electricity is and how any shortages are allocated throughout the state.
So these are serious responsibilities given to these stakeholder boards and no public official participates on those boards.
"You are more right than wrong.
As the chief executive of this state I am going to advocate what I believe is in the best interests of our consumers and businesses.
Electricity is the lifeblood of our economy.
Without water and electricity, consumers and businesses are just simply out of luck.
Whether or not this deregulatory scheme in 1996 made sense then is a question not worth debating today.
But it does not make sense today.
Unfortunately that plan adopted by our legislature and governor Wilson in 1996 surrendered control over generating facilities that the PUC used to monitor and supervise.
So it is unclear how much power is left to the state.
FERC seems to be suggesting today, not much.
Obviously as governor of this state I want to assert as much authority as I possibly can because I know I will be held accountable and obviously I would like the authority to go along with the responsibility that is laid at my doorstep.
"I have one goal in mind: to do our level best to make sure that our lights stay on and our economy has the benefit of the electricity it needs and the prices are reasonable.
What path we take to that matters less to me than that we get to that result.
Because that is the result that is necessary to allow consumers to go about their lives and business to function and make a profit and hire more people and to sustain our economic growth which in turn provides the resources that allow us to finance the schools and protect the environment and provide healthcare.
Without electricity there is no economic growth, without economic growth we do not have the resources to do justice to our public obligations.
Thank you for coming out here today.
That is more of a challenge than you might imagine in this complicated deregulated world we find ourselves in.
I believe we are making a good start.
"Having said all that, this market is dysfunctional.
It is a very difficult environment for deregulation to work.
And I repeat again, deregulation can work but only if all parties act responsibly and if the market is competitive, which it is not.
"I was pleased to see that Secretary Richardson agrees with me that this market is dysfunctional and I am also somewhat pleased by the initial reports of the action that FERC took today.
It is a mixed blessing.
They do recognize that we are operating in a dysfunctional market and they do agree that the rates are not just or reasonable.
However, they did not, as I encouraged, order rebates to the consumers and businesses in San Diego who were literally gouged and for the profiteering and market manipulation that San Diego had to suffer through.
"FERC also decided to abolish the stakeholder boards at the ISO-independent service operator, and the power exchange.
FERC agrees with me that they are self-serving and either contributed to or participated directly in market manipulation.
However, it is unclear what will replace those boards.
The good news is that they agree with our premise that the market is dysfunctional, rates are unreasonable and unjust.
The bad news is there is no immediate remedy for ratepayers here in California.
"I believe the marketplace generally makes good decisions but I am not going to be a prisoner of ideology.
I do not want some knee jerk reactions to drive our economy or our consumers to their knees.
I have seen time and again the most right wing conservatives in San Diego that say, 'please give us money to bail us out from the increased prices that have descended upon us.'
So as I have long understood, economics drives politics and at the moment we are shipping about $6 billion more out of this state for electricity than we paid about 12 months ago.
That has got to stop.
"It appears that the FERC said they are going to restructure it and this again suggestes the complexity that we have to deal with.

Thank you for coming out here today.
SDG&E plans to use these overcollections to offset the undercollections from their cap for the subset of small customers.
This is not necessarily a DA versus SO customers, since small DA and SO customers are treated the same.
It is more of a subsidy issue between large and small customers.
However, since most DA customers are large customers, it becomes a DA and SO issue.
We also need to keep our eyes open to spot any other transfer of overcollections that should rightfully be used to reduce rates for all customers.
What is motivating SDG&E is their perceived shareholder risks with respect to the undercollections caused by the cap.
They want to reduce their exposure.
We need to be sensitive to our TURN friends, but we want to illuminate the shortcomings of this type of transition mechanism to prevent legislators and regulators from switching to this mechanism in the shortrun.
We will have to do this strategically to avoid negative consequences.
Work with PG&E and SCE on developing a post-freeze solution at the legislature to recover undercollections over a 5 year period in order to facilitate an acceptable solution.
Watch and prevent adverse changes to how the PX credit is calculated.
Here are the talking points as combined.
If you want to change, let's make sure everyone knows.
There are rumors that the Governor may call for a special session, which would expedite the treatment of energy issues.
Please provide any comments/concerns on this approach asap.
Because of the undercollections the utilities that accumulated by virtue of the rate cap for SCE and PG&E and the high summer prices, there is a strong move by the utilities to end the rate freeze as expeditiously as possible.
The components of a settlement would need to address: 1.
Rate Freeze Duration/Value of Hydro 2.
Utility Procurement and Pricing/Default Provider The proposal would be as follows: 1.
Maintain existing rate freeze through transition period (either 12/31/01 or 3/31/02).
This gives the utilities a reasonable opportunity to mitigate undercollection in TRA through valuation of hydro, and generation revenues from the hydro and nuclear facilities.
It also gives the utility time to structure its portfolio for serving its default customers-forward contract.
Maintains rate stability for consumers through tight summer supply periods.
c. Continues CPUC deliberative valuation of remaining generation assets, including hydro.
CPUC recently ordered that supplemental testimony could be filed on December 5 to adjust values to reflect recent market events.
We think that the rate freeze cannot end without a valuation of the assets, which is required by December 31, 2001.
This could be a very significant mitigation piece.
Provide an Equitable Outcome of the Undercollected Balance a.
Anything still in the account as of 12/31/01 is shareholder risk.
There may be a nice middle ground here.
I think there are some legal issues with TURN's proposal about treating current unrecovered electricity costs as "stranded" costs.
These revenues, in addition to the remaining asset valuations, will provide a substantial offset to the undercollected revenue balance.
An argument can be made that the utilities were over-exposed to the market volatility due to the lack of forward contracting.
(Others may say that the utilities should be responsible for the run-up in gas prices and ERCs and that ratepayers be responsible for the balance.
Another way, may be to look at allowing recovery of "above-cost" prices for period from June 14-Oct 2.
This presumes that the Commission will not try to pursue disgorging profits from marketers/generators.)
This amount could be amortized over a several year period (3-5 years) beginning 2002.
While the sharing may not be critical to Enron, it will be a big negotiating point between ratepayer advocates and the utilities.
Clearer definition of utilities' procurement role a.
Define utility's roles as procurer for residential and small commercial customers at a levelized price for fixed period of time (3-5 years).
This provides clarity to the utility on for whom they should contract.
It will also alleviate claims about future stranded costs when/if default role changes.
Allow procurement flexibility on meeting that responsibility.
Reasonableness will be an issue.
Need to determine if we want to propose anything or nothing.
c. Provide only POLR service to industrial customers (flow through of a spot market price plus retail adders).
d. At the end of the default transition period, begin the process of alternative default providers.

Steve, not to get too wrapped up in a name, but I think Enron Telecommunications may be confusing.
Can we use something more innocuous like Enron Communications Ltd. or Enron Communications North America?
Just thinking out loud.
It will be a owned by ECI.
Conduct regulated telecommunications activities 3.
I suggest the name Enron Telecommunications, Inc. or a variation using Telecommunications.
1) Do we know who is going to be the shareholder?
3) Is this going to be a Corporation or a LLC?
I think it would be a good idea to put the same slate of officers and directors as we have in place for ECI.
This is just an attempt to get the ball rolling so if you could get back to me I would appreciate it.
We will try to stay away from Enron Communications 2, Inc. for the name!
Please send me your suggestions!

There is an opportunity to update our existing testimony in the hydro proceeding based upon current market information.
We have to consider the FERC order and the likelihood that prices that were experienced this summer is not likely to re-occur, to the same extent, next summer.
I will submit an RCR, but want to make sure we discuss it first and give MRW adequate time to do their analysis, should we decide to file.
Let me know your thoughts.
In answer to your first point, the FERC did exempt demand side bids from the $150.
84 of the order.
I'm afraid we'll look greedy unless we focus strongly on the RETAIL affect of the low price cap and how raising it would ultimately allow retail customers to save money and wholesale markets to work more efficiently.
there is some stuff we can quote in the iso's market surveillance com report.
we also have some real world experience to draw upon (i'm told that FERC occasionally really likes to hear about the real world) -- we had a number of customers on demand responsiveness plans in the east and we sent them checks for BIG BUCKS this summer.
These are powerful examples of how price caps influence retail demand response.
This only goes so far, however...
The FERC could easily eliminate the problem by exempting demand side bids from the price caps.
SO, we need more...
The staff report provides some good evidence on why the caps are too low and we could also use the ISO's calculation of prices for short-term peaking capacity.
We have to send our issue list to FERC tomorrow so please comment on this ASAP.
We should discuss price signals including: price caps and market information Here's my rationale.
Since we'll only have five to ten minutes to talk, our comments should focus on the most important commercial issues to us: removing or improving price caps and improving market transparency by providing market information to market participants.
We could summarize the positions we took in the white paper about why the Commission shouldn't allow a price cap at all and why we need information.
In addition, our written comments will want to beef up the legal support for the Staff's conclusion about refunds and perhaps request rehearing of the Commission's decision to move the refund effective date.
I'm sure we'll find more issues as we go.
The phoenix keeps rising.
PG&E has submitted a new advice letter seeking to establish an interim valuation for its remaining hydro assets at $2.8 billion effective June 23,00.
We have 20 days from October 26 to protest.
I would assume we will want to protest, unless I hear differently.
At this point, it doesn't appear as though there will be hearings.
TURN proposed to fold the undercollected balance into the TCBA and let nature take its course through the end of the transition period.
Our comments will go toward supporting TURN, in concept, refuting utility claims of taking.
We may want to consider teeing up some of the ideas of an equitable allocation of high costs to ratepayers.
Let me know your thoughts, who else will want to weigh in on this.
On item #1, I don't believe they have the latitude through an application to change the statute language.
However, that is not our issue to raise.
I don't believe we have a problem with items #2 and 3.
The only thing we may wish to protest is the amortization of any undercollected balance in 18 months.
Considering the potential size of the undercollection, that quick a recovery could raise prices significantly and affect our deals.
Also may be rate shock.
We have 30 days from October 24 to file comments.
Accordingly, SEDGE requests that the Commission take the following additional steps: 1.
Establish a rate freeze (as oppose to a ceiling) of 6.5 cent/kWh.
The Commission should authorize SDG&E to use all the financial and physical tools available in the marketplace to procure energy for bundled service customers.
The Commission should provide guidance for SDG&E's exercise of its procurement function (e.g., price stability v. least cost procurement).
Please call if you have any questions.

Just a reminder that the first lecture in the Annual Business Faculty Research Dialogue Series will take place on November 3rd.
Lane, General Partner of Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and former President of Oracle Corporation, will be the first speaker in this series.
The lecture will begin at 4:00pm in the Arthur Andersen Auditorium and there will be a reception in the Bank of America Forum immediately following the program.
There is open seating for this program - all are invited to attend. ?
We would probably want to protest that issue.
SDG&E agrees with ORA's assessment.
SDG&E's energy procurement reasonableness case presumably would continue to be presided over by ALJ Barnett.
I would appreciate your thoughts on this proposal.
Please call me if you have any questions.

GREETINGS: So, we're all happy that FERC finally made a decision.
Traders tell me the market has stabilized and people think much of the regulatory uncertainty has ended.
NOT SO FAST.....
I am NOT an attorney -- but here are my current guesses.
ISSUE: FERC has created a huge constitutional issue with the state of CA.
The FERC has ordered the ISO to do something differently than what was specified in the state legislation, AB 1890.
The last time this happened, in late 1999 (on ISO and PX governance), the state reared its back -- and FERC caved in.
So let's not be sanguine about what FERC has done here.
Much will need to be done by Enron and others to bolster FERC.
THE COURTS: The state could get its back up and decide to fight this.
The potential is that FERC will get political pressure to "settle", once a request for rehearing is submitted.
Remember --- this is ALL political.
It's not about logic.
Last time, the state, through the Oversight Board, submitted a request for rehearing with FERC.
FERC told them to pound sand, so the EOB then filed in federal court to overturn the order.
This was "settled" when the state negotiated with FERC behind the scenes and FERC did a 180.
(We have a court case pending on that order.)
If the state decides to go the rehearing route, I'm not too sure when they could initiate court action.
They could probably file for an emergency stay, but they tried that in the last court case and it was rejected.
GOVERNOR: A little has been trickling out.
Davis went to town at a press conference yesterday, talking about gouging generators and sending $6 billion out of state.
He stated his unhappiness with the FERC not providing refunds.
He says his adminstration will continue its fight to have refunds ordered.
His administration will "participate fully" in the FERC hearing on Nov 9.
The Governor believes that the state lost control of its transmission system when it passed 1890.
So, I could conceive of some legislation or a federal push to "give it back."
I don't think that would be ultimately successful, but it would likely create some wild times.
FEDERAL: The press reported that U.S. Sen Feinstein will introduce a measure in the next few days to give FERC retroactive refund authority.
STATE LEGISLATURE: State Sen Bowen has said she plans to hold a hearing in mid-month and will draft a "legislative response to the FERC proposal."
Assemblyman Rod Wright met with about 30 people today (suppliers and utilities) to explore some issues.
He wants to take leadership of the issue and is supported by the Speaker of the House.
He plans legislative action.
CONSUMER ADVOCATES: Press reports state that several consumer organizations are considering court action to get the refunds.
TIMING: Soon and sooner.
Hearings can happen any time.
The legislature returns in January and we can expect emergency legislation and a quick pace.
Hold on to your hats!
I agree we should have the work performed and we can talk about whether we file it later.
We have to consider the FERC order and the likelihood that prices that were experienced this summer is not likely to re-occur, to the same extent, next summer.
I will submit an RCR, but want to make sure we discuss it first and give MRW adequate time to do their analysis, should we decide to file.
Let me know your thoughts.
Actually, how about Enron Communications Broadband Services?
It is similar to Telecommunications but sounds much more advanced.
Can we use something more innocuous like Enron Communications Ltd. or Enron Communications North America?

We would need to protest, but of course strategically.
Can we discuss anything that goes out?
PG&E has submitted a new advice letter seeking to establish an interim valuation for its remaining hydro assets at $2.8 billion effective June 23,00.

Advice Letters: San Diego filed an advice letter (1260-E) which I faxed two weeks ago dealing with the application of the rate cap to DA customers.
The earlier advice letter had a lot more specificity about how to deal with applying the credit to DA customers that the amended advice letter omits.
We need to determine if we wish SDG&E to include any of the following in their treatment of the credit for DA customers.
We have 20 days from October 30 to file a protest.
For example: If the customer received consolidated billing service from the utility, the credit from the cap would be applied against the otherwise applicable San Diego charges.
If the customer was dual billed, the credit would apply against the San Diego portion of the bill.
If the customer received ESP consolidated billing from the ESP, the credit would be highlighted through a separate line item.
If the credit surpassed SDG&E's charges, there would be no amount payable to SDG&E for that month.
If there was a credit balance remaining against SDG&E's charges, it could be carried over into the next month, or cashed out.
SDG&E provided a second option.
This would provide the credits to the ESP and the ESP would be responsible for any future repayment of the cost.
We have until November 7 to file comments on their proposal.
I think we would appreciate a separate line-item identifying the amount of the credit.
However, I believe the identification should be the same for all customers, irrespective of the billing choice.
We may also want to consider if we have a preference for how we would handle the additional credit relative to the cap for our customers.
That may help us decide if we want to support having the option of choosing between a line-item or managing those funds for our customers.
(This is another way of alleviating a customer's concern about a balloon payment at some future date.)
Some ESPs are also approaching SDG&E about an "opt-out" provision of the rate cap for DA customers.
I am concerned, and am checking, to see if SDG&E can legally do this.
Customer Facilitation Program: The majority of the ESPs elected to wait until the issue of the implementation of the rate cap was decided before doing a mailing.
The majority also preferred one mailing to two.
Therefore, this program will not kick off until probably some time in January 2001.
Any questions, feel free to contact me.

I just got a call from someone who apparently has a lot of capacity available and wants to know if he can somehow exploit Enron's bandwidth trading platform to market it.
Is there someone I can have him get in touch with to find out if it's possible?
Mary, Can we tone down the demand-side management language.
Our short-term retail position in California is that the rate freeze by law should be maintained until December 31, 2002.
Of course, in the long-run we believe demand-side management and demand elasticity is and important tool toward managing the prices in California.
Perhaps you can refer to demand elasticity as a long-run goal or focus your discussions on demand elasticity with respect to the utilities' current tools in their interruptible tariffs.
Also, you could focus more on the utilities' new ability to purchase outside the PX.
I am afraid that coming out too strong on demand-side management as a short-run solution plays into the utilities' hands to end the rate freeze early to the detriment of the retail market.
However, I have not attempted to incorporate Sue's comments from earlier today.

Leave this to the UDCs -- we are also OK with the penalty.
The main problem for the ISO operators is the lack of resources being scheduled day-ahead, so I think we should be OK with that penalty.
While the companies generally described FERC's plan as a starting framework to repair the market, they said more steps are needed before final changes can be adopted.
FERC said earlier Wednesday that a probe into California's newly deregulated electricity markets showed drastic changes were needed to prevent a repetition of this past summer's price spikes and near power blackouts.
FERC also blocked a new price cap plan for wholesale electricity that was due to be implemented later this month by the California Independent System Operator, which oversees operation of most of the state's power grid.
Bids above $150 per megawatt hour could not set the market clearing prices paid to all bidders.
PG&E said in a statement the bid framework is "a creative attempt to fix the market and moderate prices, while still allowing competition to evolve."
Carl sounds like he is interested, but has other things on his mind at the moment.
Alice has some silly concern about a roof over her head, saying that she needs to take care of the house first.
If anyone else is considering the trip, please let me know soon.
The big question is about the timing.
Rob and Nora have expressed a preference for August.
Pat is trying to get Intel to spring for her airfare by calling it a business trip (can you say, "Junket").
Because Pat has only the best interest of the company in mind, she feels April would be a good time to go.
My preference is to go just before or after the tourist season, which would be the beginning of June or September.
The folks at Porlock advised me thus: Depending on the wetness of the winter season, the outdoor jump arenas and x-country courses open in early May to early June.
By mid June, the local tourist season is in full-swing.
Bookings will be more difficult, and we will have to compete with a good bit of traffic on the roads and trails during hacks.
Hikers use the same trails that we will canter.
The tourist season lasts through August, when much of Europe and the UK are taking Summer holidays.
So, please help me find a time that is suitable for everyone.
My vote is to go at the end of August - Beginning of September.
What do you think of that?
PS - Pat, I am only kidding.
What's the point of working for a multi-national if you can't get some good trips out of it?

Sandi and Dave and Mike will dicuss further on the call on Monday but wanted to disseminate info regarding the meeting that Joe Ronan of Calpine offered on an IEP call today: The meeting was attended by a lot of folks of all stripes.
Wright was very critical of how the Governor is handling the issue and wants to craft a solution with the industry and then invite the Governor to get on board.
Wright threw a whole laundry list of options on the table for folks to consider (Dave's typing up his notes from the meeting for distribution later today) One of Wright's key concern is forward contracting.
The utilities said that Loretta Lynch is the problem with the onerous "prudence" criteria she's imposing on utility forward contracts.
Those onerous criteria keep the utility from contracting.
The utility, under this framework, has broad flexibility to contract forward, i.e., PUC gets out of the way.
The utilities told Rod Wright that they did not want, nor did they have the expertise, to get back into the generation business.
I have NO idea how I sent the email to jackie at kim's email address.
did you guys meet last nite to discuss the project?
If not, do you want to meet this weekend for a wee bit to discuss?
just let me know.

Possible to meet this weekend to discuss the project?
Either day's fine with me.
Apologies for the last minute change.
you going to the game?
Sunday will probably be better (as long as it doesn't conflict with 49ers).
I have got Mike & Lisa and Renee & Doug and Sean & Molly so far.
I have not heard back from Steve or Ed (both emails and phone).
I will have to send another request.
is there a time you could go?

We would propose to split our monthly billings for legal fees and expenses equally between the parties who agree to join such a coalition.
However, most of the face to face negotiating, including working with Commissioners and advisors as necessary, would be done by myself as lead partner on the case.
I have attached a fee schedule for the GMSRD attorneys who would likely have some involvement in the case.
Because the majority of this work will be done in 2001, these rates reflect our new 2001 hourly fees.
With this discount, these would be the lowest fees available to any of our clients in the coming year.
I have not made any type of estimate of legal expenses for this proceeding, as it is exceedingly difficult to forecast how protracted the proceedings will be.
Once we begin participating in the proceeding and we collectively decide how best to proceed in terms of actual participation in the case, we can provide frequent budget reports and make more useful budgetary estimates.
If you require some type of estimation sooner than that, please let me know.
Thank you for your interest in using our services.

Pennsylvania's First Successful CDS Auction ?
The consumer savings that these offers represent is masked or reduced by t= he=20 stranded cost payments that consumers must pay PECO Energy.

Finally, the result of this case will switch more customers = to=20 competitive suppliers in one day than the total number who switched in=20 California over a period of nearly three years.=20 ?
The incumbent utility is the default supplier, unless the P= UC=20 decides otherwise.
The default supplier must provide generation service to= =20 customers who do not have a competitive supplier either because they chose= =20 not to shop or did not find a willing supplier at an acceptable price.
The= =20 PECO Restructuring Case Settlement initially defined CDS service in=20 paragraph 38: ?
The same approach was used in the other Settlements in the GPU, PPL and APS= =20 restructuring cases.

PECO issued its initial RFP for CDS on April 6, 2000, and Shell Energy =20 Services submitted the only bid.

Fellas, please read below.
Do we have a need for extra capacity in California?
Mitch, could this be a re-sell opportunity?
Let me know if this is at all attractive.
The ISO contracted with MCI (a couple of years ago) to build a broad band network ( OC-48) to support electricity deregulation in California.
(Friends of mine at MCI worked on the deal.)
The ISO is none to happy about having been sold an "overbuild" network by MCI.
But given MCI's reputation, the ISO is looking at marketing the capacity rather than trying to re-negotiate the contract with MCI.
Sounds like the capacity runs between Sacramento (Folsom?)
and Southern California (Alhambra?).
Could be an opportunity for ECI to get some quality capacity at a substantial discount.
Please pass along to ECI folks for their assessment.
 Please forward to Gov't Affairs group.
Of course, I will be hurt and disappointed if the Sellers family doesn't vote its conscious, doesn't vote for the candidate that truly represents the values that the Sellers family stands for.

He's worse than Bush, because he's more of a political robot.
The logical choice is, of course, as Jeff pointed out, Nader.
The result will be that Nader loses, Gore loses, and Bush wins.
But, four bad years is worth the political message it will send, especially if it's strong.

My understanding is that Martin and Doug are going to be focused on DG in California.
There are approximately 120 MWs of load we hope to sign up, using First Energy's Market Support Generation.
We also need to prepare a PR plan in case our contracted load is significantly less than our acquired generation.
Cinergy is being targeted as a new commodity opportunity.
The intent is to take advantage of the shopping incentive made available to the first 20% of load that switches when the Ohio market opens 1/1/01.
The Texas Commission's ruling allowing negative stranded costs will not yet be marked into the retail curves due to the uncertainty surrounding the decision.
Personnel issues: Mark Courtney is now the regional sales lead for Texas, replacing Jay Ferry.
Eric Letke is now the regional sales lead for California, replacing Doug Condon.

I plan to publish the weekly report for Tim Belden's group on Wednesdays.
Please forward any new developments and/or updates to me at your earliest convenience.
Thanks for your attention to this matter.
From today's Electricity Daily re last week's FERC action: ?
Commentary: Price Caps Cap Capacity, Not Prices "We should have learned the lesson by now.
Price caps don't cap prices.
Price caps cap capacity.
The same phenomena cropped up in the 1970s with oil price controls and in the 1980s with natural gas price controls.
The major slippery slope in the FERC California plan is its "price mitigation" approach.
It is not really a price cap, not even a "soft cap" as advertised by some.
Under the FERC approach, bids under $150/MWh will work as before, with the highest bid setting the market clearing price.
But for bids above $150, a bidder would get what it bid (if dispatched), but the high bid would not set the clearing price for other bidders.
So it's not a price cap.
Commissioner Curt Hebert says he fears that having the prospect of FERC looking over their shoulders, and the possibility of refunds in the future, would scare some capacity out of the market.
He may be right.
More to the point, the whole thing may be unnecessary.
The other steps FERC is taking are probably sufficient to kick-start to competitive marketplace.
Nothing has screwed up the California process more completely than the board shenanigans, particularly the political food fights at the ISO board meetings.
As a journalist, I'm sorry to see them go.
But as a businessman and a devotee of good public policymaking, I say good riddance.
Indeed, FERC should have gone farther and ordered the merger of the PX and the ISO.
Separating the two was another case of where California allowed politics to overcome sound reason, Californicating the restructuring.
Among other things, the separate institutions, with separate staff and separate procedures, drive up transaction costs.
A much sounder model comes in PJM, where one-stop shopping prevails.
But, taken together and acknowledging that FERC's California action plan is only the beginning, I have to give the FERC staff and the commission high marks.
Unfortunately, in typical FERC fashion, they have managed to launch a major undertaking during the coming holiday season.
Coal in the stockings for that one, folks."
Given the emphasis from all quarters on the need for retail competition to make California work, would seem useful to strike a balance between the degree to which the comments emphasize wholesale and retail reforms.
And for the record, Sue, no I don't talk like that.
I'm afraid we'll look greedy unless we focus strongly on the RETAIL affect of the low price cap and how raising it would ultimately allow retail customers to save money and wholesale markets to work more efficiently.
there is some stuff we can quote in the iso's market surveillance com report.
we also have some real world experience to draw upon (i'm told that FERC occasionally really likes to hear about the real world) -- we had a number of customers on demand responsiveness plans in the east and we sent them checks for BIG BUCKS this summer.
These are powerful examples of how price caps influence retail demand response.
This only goes so far, however...
The FERC could easily eliminate the problem by exempting demand side bids from the price caps.
SO, we need more...
The staff report provides some good evidence on why the caps are too low and we could also use the ISO's calculation of prices for short-term peaking capacity.
We have to send our issue list to FERC tomorrow so please comment on this ASAP.
We should discuss price signals including: price caps and market information Here's my rationale.
Since we'll only have five to ten minutes to talk, our comments should focus on the most important commercial issues to us: removing or improving price caps and improving market transparency by providing market information to market participants.
We could summarize the positions we took in the white paper about why the Commission shouldn't allow a price cap at all and why we need information.
In addition, our written comments will want to beef up the legal support for the Staff's conclusion about refunds and perhaps request rehearing of the Commission's decision to move the refund effective date.
I'm sure we'll find more issues as we go.

There is no denying the power of good public relations to launch a company from the ground up, build the brand and support a company's business and marketing plans over time.
But in today's fast-moving economy, clutter abounds.
News about a company is often ignored if it doesn't have a big number attached to it, tell a bigger story or have a unique twist.
Editors and writers filter out pitches and releases that sound alike.
How to break through the clutter?
I hadn't included Marcie on the call, but would be happy to include her, too.

Mary: Please include me in the call with Mr. Sanders & Co. Best, Jeff
Jeff Again, here is PG&E trying to shoe horn us on this tap vs. bus connection issue.
If you are not familiar with this issue, EES elected to utilize the single tap termination @ the PG&E Bullard Substation in our proposal to CSUF.
This single tap option was provided to us by PG&E in their Informational Review.
PG&E itemized this cost in the Informational Review at $178,000 and this the figure we used.
PG&E has stated that it is reserved for future expansion and we must go with a bus connection.
Of course going with a bus connection adds cost to the scope of work that PG&E will provide at the Bullard Sub.
My question is there any avenue to contest this?
Would PG&E have a design in place or have notified the PUC of their intentions to conduct this work?
If you could give me some suggestions, I would appreciate it.
I just do not want to yield to PG&E if there is something I can do.
You will be receiving the original by overnight delivery in the next couple of days.
Have you decided how and where we are able to receive the Study ?
Please let me know what arrangements I can assist with .
 I would be happy to pick it up at the Learning Center if that is convenient.

 <<X18138.DOC FYI here is what Rod discussed at his meeting.
Please see the attached articles:
They are primarily legal arguments.
Concerning his comments about the congestion management redesign - I'm not sure that we want to oppose LMP.
I think instead we want to ensure that there are not a large number of nodes.
Alan will be writing the technical comments on the $150 caps, not Seabron.
Sue called me this morning and said IEP will not be contesting the $150 price cap.
This is too bad because we had hoped they would carry the ball on arguing why $150 is not sufficient to incent peaking generation.
Sue is working on IEP to try to get them to reconsider.
I think we also need to make sure we make all of the arguments that relate to the CPUC's subpoena.
Please tell Lysa if I haven't listed you and you wish to be on this call.
 I'm not too happy about this.
But next time let's talk about sending it out before we send it out to the list of business folks.
We need to make sure that our information flow out to the business units is consistent and metered.
I'll be participating in a "round table discussion" on California next Monday on the Berkeley campus.
It's being sponsored by the Policy School and some folks from the Business School.
Laura Tyson and a former FCC mucky-muck (Howard Shalansky) will moderate the two panels.
Alums who now work in the energy biz are putting up funding for the event (e.g., Columbia, American Public Power Ass.)
We're providing a modest stipend.
There are two "round tables."
First one is "Why did we do this?," and the second one is "Where to from here?"
I'll be on the second panel.
Go to the attached website for agenda and other info.
I intend to pull from the messages, filings and other materials that we've developed over the course of the last several weeks/months.
I'll distribute talking points for review and comment sometime this week.
But please feel free to send thoughts, suggestions, etc.
 If you have not logged onto the PEP system to designate reviewers, or approve reviewers for those in your organization, please do so today.
The deadline for completing performance evaluation information is November 17.
The performance review process is critical to year-end evaluations and bonus, promotion and compensation decisions.
Please take some time today to get the process started.
There is no rule for fifteen days per se.
You actually have 60 days to respond.
In the Detailed Study, we requested a written notice to proceed by February 1, 2000 to make CSUF/Enron's target completion date for the new substation online.
CSUF/Enron can take up to 60 days, but doing so will impact the desired schedule and necessitate a scheduling change.
Hi, all: We are planning another series of Open Houses for prospective students in December and early next year, and we are hoping to broaden the geographic area in which we host these events.
We are currently thinking of having Open Houses in the Sacramento area, the North Bay, and the Peninsula.
Does anyone have suggestions for appropriate venues?
The requirements are pretty simple - the space would need to seat about 200 people and have very basic equipment (i.e.
In the past, we have held Open Houses at hotels, since they are easily located and able to provide light refreshments.
Jeff You are correct, that is the correct number -- talk to you soon!
Hi Brian - have you heard anything about when we might expect a proposed decision on Phase 1 issues from Michelle Cooke.
(Jeff, I'm trying to get information for Martin Wenzel on DG).
Marcie should be on the call.
should also be included only the business units should be uninvited.
i'm calling marcie as we speak.
should also be included only the business units should be uninvited.
I haven't heard anything specifically, but ALJs are supposed to issue their proposed decisions within 90 days of submission.
But this rule isn't strictly enforced, and Michelle has been very busy in a lot of her proceedings.
I would still expect the PD shortly (by Thanksgiving, if not sooner).
(Jeff, I'm trying to get information for Martin Wenzel on DG).
Jeff, I read in Gas Daily that the Cal PUC has issued an OII on the adequacy of supply and pipeline infrastructure in southern California.
Could you have someone send me a copy of the order whenever it is issued?
Steve thinks it's something we might want to get involved in, but I need to know more.
Great to see you last week.
You're certainly becoming a regular on the energy speaker's circuit!

The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power is refusing to sell outside of California for less than $250.
This is diminishing liquidity in the market.
However, we can't call FERC and complain because munis are not regulated by FERC.
Here is an example of something we should be bringing to NW congressional members re why FERC should regulate the munis.
A quick download on our conference call: We agreed to split the larger group up into 3 working groups.
The 3 of us are in the southern group.
(I, for one, would be happy if all future meetings were held in Mexico City or San Francisco.)
By Feb 29, we are to circulate to the larger group a report on existing commercial problems along the US/Mexico border, e. g. continuing difficulties with El Paso Electric and moving power across the border, and recommendations for their solution.
Those recommendations could be much farther reaching than just a complaint action against the utility.
It is my impression that there could be significant opportunities if we could move more power south across the border, but that there is real intransigence on the part of the utilities on this side.
I have no idea what the situation is on the other side of the border.
Why don't we trade emails and voicemails over the next few weeks and try to schedule a conference call the week of Feb 14?
That will give us about 2 weeks to get a written report together and to follow up on our brilliant discussions.
If you have a better idea, let me know.
We're already into the third week of the HW Survivor Contest - two contestants have been given the boot and five contestants remain.
Now is your chance to sway the results - go to www.haasweek.net and vote somebody off of the HaasWeek Island!
The polls are only open until Wednesday at 5pm, so vote now!
Immunity challenge update: this past weekend we held our second immunity challenge, and we tied it in with the Special Olympics Fall Sports Classic held up in Sacramento.
The HW Survivor contestant who recruited the most participants for the weekend gained immunity for Round 3, and this time it was no contest!
Wendy Hsu earned immunity for the second straight round when 7 volunteers gave her credit for recruiting them, plus Wendy showed up herself for an additional two points!
No other HW Survivor contestant got more than one.
So congratulations, Wendy - another round of breathing easy!
(Oh, and vote in the government elections on Tuesday, too.)
Thanks, HaasWeek - winmail.dat

Gee, and at $120/bottle, I can load up on a few cases.
At that price, the Mondavi's must be hoping Bush wins so America can spend the tax break on that tasty Reserve.
Do you qualify for the discount on the Reserve, too?
Even at Robert Mondavi, which has produced its share of impressive cabs, the 1997 reserve stands out.
The 1997 vintage was the best of the 1990s in the Napa Valley, yielding rich, concentrated red wines.
Robert Mondavi Reserve's showy aromas of spice, cassis, and cedar make a strong impression in the glass.
Quite closed now, the dark profile keeps its cards close to the vest.
One thing for sure: this definitely one for the cellar.
The finish is lengthy, with brisk tannins as well as espresso and bitter-chocolate notes.
Hold for eight to ten years; this wine should keep till 2020.
In my continual pursuit for wine nirvana, I have traveled to Bordeaux and back with stops in Italy and Australia and for what?
Besides losing my luggage, tracking through customs and using non-functional phone cards, I have been searching for that wine of perfection.
Could this wine finally be the one?
This just released Opus One may be the absolute finest young red wine I have ever tasted in a bottle (barrel samples don't count).
Persistent to the point of perfection, this wine does not allow its captive audience to escape its web of Cabernet ecstasy.
This is my top wine of the year.
It brings out the best in the 1997 vintage.
FERC has not yet issued on the list of panel participants for the November 9 conference, but we will circulate it as soon as it is posted on FERC's web site.
Julie has heard that each panel will have approximately 6 people, and each person will be given 5 minutes to make a presentation.
Each panel will have 90 minutes total, so FERC is probably planning on having a significant dialogue with each panel after formal comments are made.
Also, Scott Miller called Julie today and told her that FERC is feeling somewhat beleaguered by industry response to the California order.
FERC feels that they issued a good order for marketers and generators, and they would like to hear positive responses from market participants at the meeting on Thursday and in the written comments on November 22.
in addition to raising our concerns about the price mitigation measures.
Please let me know if you have any questions.
We'll let you know as soon as we get the order for the November 9 meeting.

Greetings Wayne: Sorry that I missed the last meeting.
Now don't shoot me, but I was wondering if it might be possible to have the meetings on Thursday mornings.
That way I could actually be in Houston for the meetings (which my schedule doesn't permit me to do on Wednesdays).
But if Thursdays can fit into folks' schedule, that would be great.
Thanks and talk to you on Wednesday.
Dear class: Attached are the overheads for session 7.

I just want to confirm how we have agreed to proceed: We will start our work focussing on " b) Commercially Significant Interfaces" rather than "a) Identification etc."
, on the understanding that our work on the regional issues may shift into a discussion of a).
* I will approach Mary Hain to join the group and work in the Northwest subgroup.
Each subgroup will produce a workplan and focus document by the end of February.
Those three documents will be circulated to the whole group and discussed on a conference call for the whole group in the first week in March.
; but the group will endeavour to do all of its group-level work by e-mail and telephone.
We will aim to have a work product to deliver from the group by May.
At this stage, it is likely that the final work product will consist of a document or documents identifying impediments and opportunities and the ways of mitigating/pursuing them.
However, as we discussed on the call, we should keep an open mind about the nature of the work product.
We will have a better idea of what work product to aim for after the completion/review of the initial workplans.

 - A farmer got pulled over by a state trooper for speeding,?
and the trooper started to lecture the farmer about his speed, and in general began to throw his weight around to try to make the farmer uncomfortable.
Finally, the trooper got around to writing out the ticket, and as he was doing that he kept swatting at some flies that were buzzing around his head.?
The farmer said, "Having some problems with circle flies there, are ya?"
So the farmer says-"Well, circle flies are common on farms.
they're called circle flies because they're almost always found circling around the back end of a horse."
The trooper says, "Oh," and goes back to writing the ticket.
The farmer says, "Oh no, officer.
I have too much respect for law enforcement and police officers to even think about calling you a horses ass."
back to writing the ticket.
After a long pause, the farmer says, "Hard to fool them flies though."
yes, but again limited to 12 bottles (at a time)?
If you space them out they never know!

I think the three of us are all of the same opinion that the sale of a private line between LA and San Jose is an intrastate service under part I of the analysis that I forwarded, as the transmission is explicitly defined as an offering between two points in one state, and does not form part of an integrated interstate offering.
Enron will be hard-pressed to say that it had no idea the service was intrastate when it specifically sells capacity on an intrastate route with identified end points in a single state.
Please let me know if you have further questions, or need any of the documents noted in my previous communication.
Please call or email with any questions.

Others: Any problems with changing the meeting to Thursdays?
Currently, my schedule doesn't permit me to be in Houstons on Wednesday mornings.
But Thursdays would work.
If it makes things too complicated, not a problem.
Now don't shoot me, but I was wondering if it might be possible to have the meetings on Thursday mornings.
That way I could actually be in Houston for the meetings (which my schedule doesn't permit me to do on Wednesdays).
But if Thursdays can fit into folks' schedule, that would be great.
Thanks and talk to you on Wednesday.

I don't know for sure if that will help, but you will have to recruit those guys more carefully.
Let me know if you need anything else.
We're scheduled to talk with Dan Clearfield at 2:00 (CDT) today.
The call in number is 888-311-9051.

Tracy: I've made the assumption that our standing bridge line is available at that time.
Please let me know if that's a problem.
All, Thanks to everyone who attended the EBS strategy session in New Orleans last week.
I know how busy everyone is and Donald and I greatly appreciate your willingness to work with us to better support EBS and Enron's communications interests.
I would be happy to follow up with anyone who didn't get a chance to make it.
I am attaching our meeting notes, to be followed (due to size concerns) by the presentations from EBS Network Development and EBS Sales.
I am in DC this week, so if anyone needs to contact me, try my cell at 503-807-2935.
I can be on the call.
The OII notes that the state currently has a, "mismatch between supply and demand statewide and in specific geographic areas."?
An appendix to the OII lists various system upgrades which may require improvements.?
The investigation, "will examine the most cost-effective ways of easing transmission constraints and associated generation shortfalls, both in the short term and the longer term." ?
The Commission has classified the investigation as a ratesetting proceeding and ordered the three?utilities to file a cost/benefit analysis on new transmission upgrades as well as their own ability to build new peaking generation for next summer.
Their responses are due Nov. 22.?
ISO and other interested parties have until December 20 to files analyses and comments on the utilities' November 22 filings.?
WPTF should discuss this new OII at its meeting on the 14th to decide if it wishes to become involved.?
Please let me know if you want a copy of the OII.? ?
The following is excerpted from the 11/7 issue of Electricity Daily: ?
and questions whether Cal-ISO has siting authority for a slew of transmission upgrades to be built by utilities to hasten more power into the state's strained system.
The CPUC has authority over utilities, but Cal-ISO is the agency that is approving transmission upgrades to be built by utilities and complementary new generation to be built by market forces to hook into that transmission.
Although the CPUC has not stepped fully into the new generation siting process -- so far, a procedure that has been up to Cal-ISO and the California Energy Commission -- it does use the transmission inquisition as a foundation to question both transmission and generation projects."

In case you thought our utility competitors had deep pockets........ ############################################################################## ###################################### This election is brought to you by ...
Corporations lavished more money than ever before on this year's political campaigns.
So who stands to benefit?
The Center for Responsive Politics estimates that by the time the last "soft-money" dollar has been counted, the amount contributed will be the greatest haul of its kind in the history of U.S. politics -- $3 billion for the federal elections alone.
By the center's estimates 50 percent more dough has been contributed to campaigns this year than in the last presidential campaign season.
We have companies like AT&T, Microsoft, Citigroup and Verizon Communications to thank for underwriting the blizzard of campaign propaganda.
The surging economy isn't the only reason that contributions are up.
Since both the presidential race and control of the House are up in the air, many companies are betting that the wisest strategy is to prudently fund both sides of the aisle.
"There are no safe bets this year," says Larry Makinson, executive director of the center.
"They've got to protect themselves by giving to both sides, and they're being shaken down mercilessly by fundraisers."
Not surprisingly, many of the biggest contributors are in highly regulated industries like telecommunications and finance.
Based on the latest available data from the Federal Election Commission, AT&T is the biggest single contributor to this year's election.
As of Oct. 1, the telecommunications company -- a perennial major donor -- had given more than $4.3 million, with 62 percent of that money going to Republicans.
AT&T has been lobbying Congress to change federal regulations that will force the telecommunications giant to sell some of its cable holdings.
Mergers are a huge reason for companies to give, give and give some more to members of the House and Senate.
Microsoft, still trying to recover from its antitrust hangover, is the second largest corporate donor -- having given more than $3.4 million at last count.
Bill Gates and Co. seem to have learned their lesson from years of neglecting to remember political friends at election time.
"I joke that what Microsoft is really after is legislation that makes it legal to give direct contributions to federal judges," says Makinson.
The company has given almost evenly to Republican and Democratic forces this year.
But if business contributions and union contributions are taken in aggregate, the for-profit guys outspent the unions 15 to 1.
Also, many of the top individual contributors are corporate CEOs who give their own money to a candidate in addition to what their corporation might donate.
Kenneth Lay, CEO of Enron, had at last count also contributed more than $300,000 of his own money -- almost exclusively to Republican causes -- this year.
The moral of the story seems to be: Give, or take your chances.
For many companies, opening up their ample wallets is undoubtedly intended not just for political favors but as a defense mechanism in case they should face some public relations debacle that congressional hearings wouldn't help.
"That probably was Firestone's big problem," says Makinson.
"They don't give enough campaign contributions.
They give virtually nothing."

They prefer using the WSPP contract rather than EEI.
We will keep pounding on them until they see the light but it will likely take longer.
Plus they are far more skittish re: longer dated transactions thatn the other utilites.

Dave Parquet and I spoke with Smutney of IEP re: herding the cats.
He also said that he hadn't planned on mentioning price caps in his remarks.
We expressed concern that it would be hard for the head of California's generator association to avoid the topic.
We stressed the importance of having IEP disagree with FERC's cap proposal and offered the following message points: Price caps have failed in the past and they'll fail again.
FERC's and California's immediate goal ought to be to make the bold reforms necessary to create real, competitive markets and eliminate the need for price caps altogether.
It ain't rocket science, and it works.
The CPUC gets out of the way and stops the practice of "after-the-fact" reviews of power purchases.
Creating a retail market If California/FERC adopt these reforms, the need for caps will vanish.
FERC got a lot right in the order, but the price cap proposal is flawed.
Price is too low to incent development of peakers---well-functioning, efficient markets require peakers.
Information disclosure provisions are too costly and unnecessary.
IEP written comments will offer suggestions on how to remedy the flaws in the proposed cap.
Smutney was comfortable with these points and is open to hearing more from us today and tomorrow.
If folks have comments on these points, or have others we should discuss with Smutney, don't hesitate.
Will keep you in the loop on what's going on between now and Thursday.
And don't hesitate if you need anything, or if there's anything that you want to add to the stew.

 November 1, 2000 Chairman James Hoecker Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 888 First Street, N.E.
 Washington, DC 20426 Dear Chairman Hoecker: I want to compliment you and your fellow Commissioners and staff on the substance of your initial proposed order concerning the California market.
I am writing to share my initial reaction and expect to provide more detailed comments in the near future.
 While the proposed order is not as clear and unambiguous as I would like it to be, your call for sweeping changes in the FERC-approved tariffs which were filed in December of 1995 is an important contribution to at least partially mitigating the exercise of market power as well as helping to establish the legal basis for what will surely prove to be a vigorous court fight.
 For California consumers, it means that there is now a legal justification for these unjust wholesale costs to not be passed on to the retail ratepayers.
 As I have indicated in prior correspondence, we disagree with your counsel's opinion that you are constrained from acting retroactively.
 However, we appreciate both your stated desire to act retroactively and your request to Congress to clarify this authority.
While we would certainly prefer that Congress act on your request, we are also confident that the Federal Court will confirm our legal analysis.
In the interim, your invitation to California to suggest equitable remedies for earlier periods, is most welcome.
As a threshold matter, a statement by you of your intention to host a settlement conference in San Diego would be most useful in moving such a remedy forward.
 I support your present proposals to restructure the previously FERC-approved tariffs to address the ability of parties to exercise market power as far as they go.
However, I do have concerns that enhancing the ability of California utilities to make forward purchases will not mitigate market power.
Since forward contracts will be based upon sellers expectations regarding real- time markets and since real-time market prices will still be distorted by the exercise of market power, forward contract prices will themselves be distorted.
 Finally, I will take particular satisfaction in the conversion of the discredited ISO and PX stakeholder boards into non-stakeholder boards.
 I do question, however, the wisdom of allowing these dysfunctional boards to have a last hurrah and choose their non-stakeholder successors.
Chairman and Commissioners, these are difficult and complex issues subject to the push and pull of gigantic economic interests.
There will be much regulatory work as well as litigation to follow.
 However, your action -- coupled with appropriate action by the California PUC -- will help assure that, as these gigantic interests fight over economic theory and their balance sheets, consumers will not foot the bill.
 Sincerely, Steve Peace Cc: Commissioner Linda K. Breathitt Commissioner Curt Hebert Jr. Commissioner William L. Massey

Your comments on this notion are eagerly sought.
Purchasing power for default customers The recently proposed FERC decision essentially puts California back where it was in 1990.
There appears to be near universal agreement that the IOUs should enter into long term power purchase agreements and limit exposure to the spot market.
FERC appears now to agree it made a mistake, and essentially orders us to start the process all over again.
However, the proposed order makes no mention of state oversight of utility purchases.
But at the briefing held last Wednesday for Bowen and legislative staff, FERC staff made it clear that they were not mandating any alternative to replace the must sell/buy requirement that they were eliminating.
Presumably the state could still mandate the IOUs buy 90% in the PX (or whatever) and still comply with the FERC order.
As long as the utilities remain regulated by the PUC, the state can control their power purchases.
The problem is that after screwing around for ten years, there is now enormous pressure to let the utilities do what they will, a result that I fear would be bad for consumers and bad for the environment.
On the other hand, there no time nor stomach for repeating the BRPU process.
My preferred solution is the establishment of a new, not for profit "utility", that would make power portfolio decisions for default customers - let's call it CalPower.?
The three existing regulated utilities would no longer sell energy at retail.
CalPower decisions would be subject to whatever public policy conditions the legislature and/or the PUC chose to impose.
However, some kind expedited review process would allow CalPower to be very nimble in the power market and recovery of their revenue requirement would be guaranteed.
Direction of CalPower could be by political appointees, elected representatives, or some combination.
My fantasy is a governance structure similar to CalPERS, in which broad legislative guidelines are interpreted by a board of directors and implemented by experienced traders.
CalPower's disadvantage appears to be that it requires yet another new state-chartered non-profit organization.
Politicians appear intent on blaming the two they have already and returning to the old utility-centric system, rather than risk their necks by proposing solutions that they then would be responsible for.
Obviously, there are many questions and details to be worked out.
Which customers would be default customers?
[My option would be to declare all customers under 50 KW permanent default customers - green or other marketers could participate through contracts for differences, but physical power would be acquired for all these customers by CalPower.
Customers 50KW would be on their own.]
What is the relationship with the PUC?
Could the role of CalPower be better filled by an existing for-profit company?
How are the benefits/costs of existing utility generation assets and PP contracts shared?
Etc Is this concept attractive enough to be worth pursuing?
The next step would be to get a group of interested parties together to put some meat on these bones and float the idea seriously - perhaps even get some draft legislation on paper to shop around.
 Could the role of CalPower be better filled by an existing for-profit company?
Any private seller would have all the same conflicts as the utilities, and then some.
(I did push this idea for PG&E's gas procurement back in the bad old Gas Accord days, but the idea got nowhere then.)
Haven't developed any numbers yet.
 I would certainly encourage shopping the idea.
Sellers will probably hate it, because this entity would have more market buying power than even the current UDCs.
But so what, that's what we want, right?
I'd suggest running it by Bill Julian for a political straight face test, but I would guess he'd like it.
And it would be a perfect vehicle for RPS, which we would certainly like to revive.
Let's keep exploring this.

Since forward contracts will be based upon sellers expectations regarding real- time markets and since real-time market prices will still be distorted by the exercise of market power, forward contract prices will themselves be distorted.
 Finally, I will take particular satisfaction in the conversion of the discredited ISO and PX stakeholder boards into non-stakeholder boards.
 I do question, however, the wisdom of allowing these dysfunctional boards to have a last hurrah and choose their non-stakeholder successors.
Chairman and Commissioners, these are difficult and complex issues subject to the push and pull of gigantic economic interests.
There will be much regulatory work as well as litigation to follow.
 However, your action -- coupled with appropriate action by the California PUC -- will help assure that, as these gigantic interests fight over economic theory and their balance sheets, consumers will not foot the bill.
 Sincerely, Steve Peace Cc: Commissioner Linda K. Breathitt Commissioner Curt Hebert Jr. Commissioner William L. Massey
I think we all need this info.
We've moved the system from EES to Corp., which is why the access has been sketchy.
Let me know how it works, we're still testing the new links.
Forward this note to all users.
Please let me know if you have any additions and/or if you are the contact person for any of these issues.
 Although I realize some of you may not be able to join on such short notice, please try to participate in a conference call in preparation for the FERC meeting on Thursday.
I'd really like to have your input.
Attached please find the updated state matrix.
If you have any questions, or notice something that needs to be changed, please let me know.

There are two articles in today's edition of the Tucson Citizen regarding the above referenced.
Apparently APS has contracted with the University of Arizona to do an estimated $5.5-6 million in business saving the university approximately $550,000.
Articles can be accessed below.
Just checking to see if your problem has been resolved.
My palm for some reason isn't syncing.
Could you have Chris give me a call to try to get it to work?
Best, Jeff 415.782.7822
The prospect of having Ms. Lynch in particular and the State of California generally as a counter party in every transaction is a huge disincentive for the utilities to transact.
(Though the situation in California has now put the utilities into a "damn the torpedoes" mode and persuaded them to transaction despite the regulatory risk.)
Clearly, the first best answer is utility-out-of-the-merchant-function.
But given the political climate in California, we're likely to have the utility in the role of buyer, at least in the near term.
For the market to work in a structure with utility as buyer, the CPUC and California need to get out of the way.
Otherwise, it's a never-ending quagmire.
A couple of PUCs ago, the CPUC set up an incentive mechanism for utility gas procurement.
Under that mechanism, a benchmark is set.
If the utility beats the benchmark, it shares the benefits with consumers.
If it does worse than the benchmark, it shares the pain with consumers.
It's a model that works, that's simple and that's compatible with competitive markets.
Given the brief time you'll have, there may be other more critical issues, but this one is getting increasing attention out here in the land of lunacy.
I'd really like to have your input.
My palm for some reason isn't syncing.
Could you have Chris give me a call to try to get it to work?

Please read chapter two, attached, for next week.
We will order the text and get it here as quickly as possible.
They are primarily legal arguments.
Concerning his comments about the congestion management redesign - I'm not sure that we want to oppose LMP.
I think instead we want to ensure that there are not a large number of nodes.
Alan will be writing the technical comments on the $150 caps, not Seabron.
Sue called me this morning and said IEP will not be contesting the $150 price cap.
This is too bad because we had hoped they would carry the ball on arguing why $150 is not sufficient to incent peaking generation.
Sue is working on IEP to try to get them to reconsider.
I think we also need to make sure we make all of the arguments that relate to the CPUC's subpoena.
Please tell Lysa if I haven't listed you and you wish to be on this call.

Try 'em out for size.
Best, Jeff Price caps have failed in the past and they'll fail again.
FERC's and California's immediate goal ought to be to make the bold reforms necessary to create real, competitive markets and eliminate the need for price caps altogether.
It ain't rocket science, and it works.
The CPUC gets out of the way and stops the practice of "after-the-fact" reviews of power purchases.
Creating a retail market If California/FERC adopt these reforms, the need for caps will vanish.
FERC got a lot right in the order, but the price cap proposal is flawed.
Price is too low to incent development of peakers---well-functioning, efficient markets require peakers.
Information disclosure provisions are too costly and unnecessary.
IEP written comments will offer suggestions on how to remedy the flaws in the proposed cap.
Wayne, Attached are draft responses to your questioner.
As I said yesterday, we tried to limit our responses to Japan and Singapore.
We address other countries as the need arises.
Please feel free to distribute the responses as you see fit.

This act provides that it is to become inoperative on January 1, 2002.
This bill would remove this limit on the operation of the California Internet Tax Freedom Act.
Status: read first time.
SB 1217: Internet broadband access.
Existing law does not address nondiscriminatory access to the Internet through wireline broadband Internet access transport providers.
This bill would enact the Internet Access Enhancement Act of 1999.
The bill would require a wireline broadband Internet access transport provider, as defined, to provide any other requesting Internet service provider, as defined, access to the broadband Internet access transport services of that transport provider, as prescribed.
Latest CPUC events: 1.
This proceeding will also address the reasonableness of SDG&E's purchases over the summer.
Such an allocation will negatively affect our retail deals who do not benefit from the rate cap.
We would oppose the cross-subsidy.
A pre-hearing conference was held on Monday, establishing a procedural schedule for the reasonableness aspect of SDG&E's filing.
The assigned Commissioner is 2.
Emergency Motions on SCE/PG&E on Revenue Undercollections.
Both SCE and PG&E filed motions to revise Commission Decisions which prevent them from carrying costs incurred during the transition period into the post-transition era.
PG&E and SCE are concerned about their ability to recover an increasing undercollection resulting from the rate freeze.
TURN had filed a motion that would allow PG&E/SCE to fold the undercollection into their stranded costs and maintain the same recovery period through 2001.
The Commission has indicated that they are only interested in interim accounting measures to provide relief.
The TURN measure gives the utilities an opportunity of recovery, which they can present to Wall Street in order to continue to issue s-t debt.
It is not a long-term solution, however, such a solution will not be dealt with in this proceeding.
There is another docket that will be opened in December to deal more broadly with issues around the continuation of the rate freeze.
Also this is likely to be the basis of a settlement going into the next legislative session.
We are generally supportive of TURN's proposal and will be filing comments on Thursday, November 9.
as far as i'm concerned ted' off the team, period.
Tomorrow's fine with me.
I am going to grind out a spreadsheet tomorrow night.
Unfortunately, my friends birthday dinner is Thursday night.
I know Ted is going to be gone for the weekend.
Can we get together tomorrow or over the weekend without Ted?
Ted is going to do some research on the discount rate, which can be dropped in to any analysis that we come up with.
We can do it at my apartment, or anywhere else you folks would like to do it.
Jeez, you're a superman.
Talk to you on the call tomorrow.
Attached is a file that has tracked the rate changes for the California IOUs since the beginning of deregulation.
We would appreciate any help you can provide in keeping this file updated.
In addition to tracking changes, we would also appreciate heads up on any filings that propose to effect any of the three categories listed above.
This also includes changes to how PX credits and RCS credits might be calculated, which is a form of unbundling.
The conference is being held primarily to accord an opportunity to the citizens of San Diego, and others who are unable to attend the Nov. 9th meeting.
SDG&E's Annual Transition Cost Proceeding This reviews reasonabless of entries in the transition cost balancing account and establishes the revenue requirement for the calendar year 2002.
Enron is concerned that the revenue requirement is intentionally set to high to produce a resulting overcollection.
SDG&E has indicated that the overcollection will be used to offset undercollections resulting from the rate cap.
All customers pay the CTC, not all customers benefit from the rate cap.
We would have a concern that the appropriate allocation of the overcollection of CTC would be returned to our customers.
Hydro The Commission has just opened another testimony phase.
Interested parties can update their testimony by December 5, based on more current market data.
We have asked MRW to update their analysis, but have not decided whether we would be filing updated testimony.
The Commission should also be releasing its Draft EIR soon.
OII into Wholesale/Retail Markets-nothing happening now but this is the place to address retail market structure issues.
RCS/DASF-no proposed decision yet.
Not likely to be issued until early 01.
ARM participated in this case.
SDG&E application implementing AB 265.
Affect our deals in San Diego.

As you are aware, PG&E and EESI is currently in dispute regarding the PX credits and resulting payments from PG&E to EESI.
I believe this issue is a sore subject for PG&E.
Can you please be vigilant with respect to the utility's Ex Parte communications, because I suspect PG&E will be raising the issue of PX credits resulting in utility payments to DA customers as a way of getting out of the rate freeze obligation.
Between us, we know them all well.
Be happy to help contact.
Couldn't persuade them to stay in D.C.?
Ought to be a lot of fun.
Hope all's well with all the craziness out there.
OK, i'm trying this again.
Jim, please let me know if you receive this.
I'm attaching the previous notes.
I'd be happy to talk with them about excess capacity.
)as the platform to launch electricity deregulation in California.
Rather than try to re-negotiate the contract with MCI, the ISO is now looking at marketing the capacity.
Sounds like the capacity runs between Sacramento (Folsom?)
and Southern California (Alhambra?).
Please correct any (unintended) inaccuracies I may have included in this very brief description.
Tom Gros is VP of Enron's global bandwidth trading group and can help determine the value/feasibility of having the ISO make use of Enron's bandwith trading platform.
Jim, meet Tom Best, Jeff
We'll need to add this to the update.
Hot off the press.
The conference is being held primarily to accord an opportunity to the citizens of San Diego, and others who are unable to attend the Nov. 9th meeting.
Can't they stay in D.C.?
A conference call is scheduled for 9:30 a.m. (PST) on Wed., Nov 8 to discuss the draft outline. ?
Note, as the Hearing is Thursday, we are working in real time to finalize this Statement.?
This is a work in progress.?
IEP will be translating the draft outline into prose continually between now and Wed noon, when we hope to finalize the Statement. ?
As a point of reference, building off the IEP Workshop we held last Friday, IEP is moving forward to develop detailed comments for the FERC proceeding on California market structure matters?
These comments are due Nov. 22.?
We anticipate these Comments to be detailed (e.g.
This Statement for the FERC Hearing on Thursday is building off of the discussion during the IEP workshop.?
The Statement is expected to be 5-10 pages, therefore by necessity it will be less substantive and exhaustive as the Nov 22 filing.?
We will be developing "talking points" as well, but these will be driven by the overall Statement. ?
Talk to you tomorrow.

Obviously they enjoy being hit with rotten tomatoes.
Does the facility have a proper security force for this?
Not to say that people in California are reactionaries or any thing . . . . You can tell FERC's doing it as a symbolic gesture since none of the other commissioners are going.
Mary sent out FERC presentations earlier today (see note copied below) that provide backup for the 9 Nov presentation.
We have updated the chart (appears on p. 12 or so) that shows year 2000 PNW hydro production relative to 1999.
You definitely want to use the updated data in the attached chart because it shows that hydro production continues to be at a depressed level.
The first one is Tim's.
It corrects some information in my presentation.
My presentation includes more verbal explanations.
Cooper and Alan - does any of the data in these presentations need to be updated?
The format allows a 5 min presentation and then 60 min of Q&A.
I need your help to make sure I have "Gore-like" command of the details.
I'll talk with you to find out what we are comfortable disclosing but please err on the side of giving whatever information you have.
Updated Belden presentation (Hain/Belden) -- I believe the latest information was as of August; I think some of the information on the cost of peaking facilities is particularly eye-opening on the price cap issue.
Comparison to PJM (Hartsoe/Novosel) -- Is the information we are seeking from the ISO and PX similar to information PJM already provides?
If so, it would be nice to tie our requests back to something the Commission has already approved.
I have the ISO market surveillance report.
Is there another ISO report?
If so, please get me a copy and provide a copy of the PX report too.
Soft cap(Belden/Hain) -- need a crisp explanation of why the "soft" nature of the cap is not sufficient.
Herding the cats(Hartsoe/mccubbin/mara/dasovich): We are asking FERC to be courageous, do the right thing and ignore the politics.
Good friend of mine's going to Napa to see wineries.
Looking for everyone's favorites to pass along.
Jeff - Here is a synopsis of the Sempra OII.
The OII orders the Sempra affiliates and parent to demonstrate that SDG&E's gas supply and transmission system are adequate to provide service to present and future core and noncore customers.
SDG&E subsequently pulled the advice letter after the Commission issued a resolution rejecting it and outlined an OII it was going to issue on this matter.
The language in the OII that was issued yesterday is substantially similar to that which was in the Commission's original draft resolution.
 The Sempra companies have been ordered to appear at a soon to be determined PHC to show cause and demonstrate that: 1.
SDG&E has adequate gas transmission supply for the 2000/2001 winter heating season, as well as the longer term supply throughout the year.
If supply is inadequate, SDG&E shall submit plans for obtaining adequate supply.
SDG&E gas and transmission supply is adequate to meet anticipated need for gas fired generation.
If not, SDG&E shall submit plans for obtaining adequate supply.
SDG&E's gas transmission service is not being adversely affected by interests of its corporate affiliate.
Recently added demands on SDG&E's capacity are not negatively impacting supply for SDG&E's customers.
and otherwise consistent with representations made to the Commission.
 We are going to need to keep a careful eye on this proceeding as it develops to make sure it stays focused on events in southern California.
Commission Bilas gave me assurances last week before the OII was issued that it was a Sempra problem, not a statewide problem.
 However, given everyone's sensitivities to EG concerns, its a proceeding that could easily be expanded beyond its current narrow focus.
I'll forward you all a copy of the order later today.
On the official agenda Jan is listed as Executive Director IEP and Chairman of the Board ISO.
We need to clarify that Jan is speaking only on behalf of IEP.
I will also be taking the 20,21,22 off .
I am requesting that the 20th be my discretionary day.
Please get back to me by Friday morning.
Thanks in advance for your consideration, Joseph
Attached is an ALJ ruling issued today in connection with the OII into interruptible programs. ?
The first individual report is now due on Wednesday, February 16 at 6pm (for both sections).
The previous deadline was February 9.
This report is the analysis of the case "EMI/CT Scanner (A) & (B)".
We'll discuss the case in class in the week of February 16.
The lecture assignments for each class remain unchanged.
Attached is an outline summary of the California gas "analogy" and PGE's proposed procurement options for its retail electric customers.
I prepared this summary to help me think about a legislative proposal for Rod Wright's list, item no.
I have to admit I am a bit fuzzy about ARM's proposal for default utility procurement service.
How far off is it from PGE's propsal, which is to offer customers one of of several standardized commodity products?
Can you share anything on ARM's position with me?
Do any of you have anything on that product?

Given the timing, we should discuss this on our conference call scheduled for tomorrow.
16 USC 824g(c) requires the Commission to make information available to state commissions as may be of assistance in state regulation of public utilities.
We should argue that 16 USC 824h(c) does not apply here given that we are not a public utility nor does the PUC regulate how much market power wholesale marketers exercise or the level of market power mitigation (these are the bases the PUC provides for explaining why it should have this information.)
This argument is unpersuasive given that the CPUC can get information about the competitiveness of the forward markets from the Wall Street Journal's listing of NYMEX prices.
I just spoke with Mary to make sure we have the same information.
Here are the facts we have so far.
On November 4th, the CPUC filed a motion with FERC to adopt the form of protective order that the CPUC entered, to compel the production of documents and to shorten time to answer.
Enron entities were NOT named in exhibit B.
This is not to say that we could not be easily added to the group.
While the motion reads as if the CPUC was moving against everybody, in fact, in footnote 2 they state they are only moving against the entities named in Exhibit B.
We will have Exhibit B in hand first thing tomorrow via FEDEX to confirm this.
To repeat, Enron is not named yet.
Given the timing, we should discuss this on our conference call scheduled for tomorrow.

Since EPMI is not a subject of the motion, why should it answer?
Lying in the weeds may be a more prudent course of action.
Here are the facts we have so far.
On November 4th, the CPUC filed a motion with FERC to adopt the form of protective order that the CPUC entered, to compel the production of documents and to shorten time to answer.
Enron entities were NOT named in exhibit B.
This is not to say that we could not be easily added to the group.
While the motion reads as if the CPUC was moving against everybody, in fact, in footnote 2 they state they are only moving against the entities named in Exhibit B.
We will have Exhibit B in hand first thing tomorrow via FEDEX to confirm this.
To repeat, Enron is not named yet.
Given the timing, we should discuss this on our conference call scheduled for tomorrow.
16 USC 824g(c) requires the Commission to make information available to state commissions as may be of assistance in state regulation of public utilities.
We should argue that 16 USC 824h(c) does not apply here given that we are not a public utility nor does the PUC regulate how much market power wholesale marketers exercise or the level of market power mitigation (these are the bases the PUC provides for explaining why it should have this information.)
This argument is unpersuasive given that the CPUC can get information about the competitiveness of the forward markets from the Wall Street Journal's listing of NYMEX prices.

Dear class: It was just pointed out to me that there is an error on the syllabus.
Also, because we are somewhat behind schedule, you can treat the Anderson reading for next week as optional.
Hope this helps a bit.

The CPUC's motion may prompt FERC to decide whether or not to allow discovery in this case under Rule 401.
As a result, we need to consider whether laying in the weeds risks losing an opportunity to present our views on whether FERC should allow discovery in a paper hearing with an expedited decisional track, particularly in light of the fact that Staff has already conducted.
Since EPMI is not a subject of the motion, why should it answer?
Lying in the weeds may be a more prudent course of action.

HiJeff-- This is the new report I mentioned yesterday.
Eric also had EEI funding to use on the study.?
I don't plan to include the study on our conference call agenda -- because I will not have time to read it -- so please plan to review it and get back to Eric or me by Nov 17 if possible.?
We find that "Permitting and encouraging retail customers to respond to dynamic prices will improve economic efficiency, discipline market power, improve reliability, and reduce the need to build new generation and transmission facilities."
The report gives several examples of recent programs and explains the many obstacles that prevent widespread adoption of these programs.
Feel free to send the draft to others you think might be willing to review it.
Thanks for the help.

Please call if you have questions.
My understanding is we are not going to be active in the proceeding.

We may just want to list as an interested party so we know what is going on in the case.

A conference call is scheduled for 9:30 a.m. (PST) on Wed., Nov 8 to discuss the draft outline. ?
Note, as the Hearing is Thursday, we are working in real time to finalize this Statement.?
This is a work in progress.?
IEP will be translating the draft outline into prose continually between now and Wed noon, when we hope to finalize the Statement. ?
As a point of reference, building off the IEP Workshop we held last Friday, IEP is moving forward to develop detailed comments for the FERC proceeding on California market structure matters?
These comments are due Nov. 22.?
We anticipate these Comments to be detailed (e.g.
This Statement for the FERC Hearing on Thursday is building off of the discussion during the IEP workshop.?
The Statement is expected to be 5-10 pages, therefore by necessity it will be less substantive and exhaustive as the Nov 22 filing.?
We will be developing "talking points" as well, but these will be driven by the overall Statement. ?
Talk to you tomorrow.

In the Assembly, they won two seats, which should put them at 48-32.
We came within 2000 votes of beating Steve Horn in Long Beach.
I have no idea about Florida.
So I think that means 50-50.
If somehow Lieberman is VP, his seat becomes vacant, and the Republican Governor of Connecticut makes the appointment.
As Hunter Thompson once said, "when the going gets tough, the wierd turn pro."
and what happened with the Cal legislature.

The roof was planned to go on AFTER the stadium was completed, just as the case says.
(In fact they actually completed the roof early but the stadium was late so they were completed together.)
 It says that the estimated completion date is March 1999 with roof by Dec 1999.
 If the stadium is to be completed by March 1999, shouldn't the roof be in by Dec 1998 ?
 This important as if it will either add 1 year to the NPV calculations or not.
 Also reading up on safeco fields history, it did start operating by summer 1999 so the roof must have been up way before that.
Hi, Jeff - Wow, what a wild election.
I'm finding it hard to concentrate on work!
But I finally picked up the business section of the UT and saw that FERC will be coming to San Diego for a meeting on Tuesday, Nov. 14.
Will you be coming down for the meeting?
If so, I'd like to meet up with you for breakfast, lunch or just a quick cup of coffee.
I'm sure if you have time that Jesse Knight will be on your schedule for something similar, so if you have time to meet, that would be great.
I've been waiting to hear back from Rick Counihan.
The last he and I talked, last Tuesday, he said that ARM had chosen one of the firms in Sacramento as its first choice, but that budget issues had to be negotiated before a final decision was made.
He said if they couldn't come to an agreement The Gable Group was the coalition's second choice -- so I'm still holding out a little hope.
If you know of any other coalitions or companies that are looking for some public relations/media relations assistance to support their business goals, would you mind please passing my name to them?
I'd really like to jump back on the electricity train.
Let me know if you'll be in town next week.
Looking forward to seeing you -- Dana Dana Perino The Gable Group 619-234-1300
Attached are some updated charts that are more accurate with respect to Enron's current estimated cost of peakers in California.
Costs are up and, to the extent you use these types of charts, you should use these updated ones.
If you do not, this information will get attached somehow to our November 22 comments.
In general, the higher the cost to build, the worse a price cap looks in terms of disincentives to pursue a project.
These "August" numbers were circulated in a presentation by Tim Belden and were filed with the FERC.
The peaker charts to reflect a 25% increase in capital costs.
Although price caps increases uncertainty and increases the cost of capital, I have not updated the charts to reflect a higher cost of capital as a conservatism.
In fact, the timing might not ever be "right."
A few thoughts: 1.
Traders do not want to sell large quantities for long terms all at once.
